Unknown Date: [[video] Ray Tracing Harmonic Functions (Extended Talk)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h13FPuBvM8)

- The talk introduces a novel sphere tracing algorithm tailored for harmonic functions.
- The method allows for larger step sizes than traditional ray marching.
- Demonstrates applications in visualizing surfaces reconstructed from point clouds and polygon soups without requiring linear solves or mesh extraction.
- Expands visualization capabilities to handle nonplanar polygons with holes and complex mathematical objects such as knots and links.
