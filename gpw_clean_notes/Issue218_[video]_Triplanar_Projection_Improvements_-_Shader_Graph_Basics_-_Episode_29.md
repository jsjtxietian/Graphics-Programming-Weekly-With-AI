2022: [[video] Triplanar Projection Improvements - Shader Graph Basics - Episode 29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsE7Tqlv8DQ)

- the video improves the tri-planar projection shader (allows texture mapping without UVs)
- shows how to make sure that texture directions are correct on all sides of the projection
- additionally shows how to convert the node graphs into a single node to make it usable from other shaders more easily
