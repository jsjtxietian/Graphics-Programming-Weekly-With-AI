2021-03-10: [Real-Time Geometric Glint Anti-Aliasing with Normal Map Filtering](http://igg.unistra.fr/People/chermain/glint_anti_aliasing/)

- the paper presents a Geometric glint anti-aliasing method that is compatible with LEAN mapping
- this is archived by using mipmapping on the tabulated slope distribution function (SDF) of the microfacet BRDF
- a slope correlation coefficient is additionally introduced to make it compatible with normal mapping
