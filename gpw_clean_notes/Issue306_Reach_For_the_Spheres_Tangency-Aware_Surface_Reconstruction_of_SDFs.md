2023-09-14: [Reach For the Spheres: Tangency-Aware Surface Reconstruction of SDFs](https://odedstein.com/projects/reach-for-the-spheres/)

- the paper introduces a new method for the triangle mesh reconstruction from an SDF representation
- The presented method is based on the insight that each SDF sample represents a spherical region
- generates an initial mesh and then shrinks the shell using a gradient flow approach
