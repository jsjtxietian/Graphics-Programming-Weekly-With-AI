2018-09-30: [CUDA 10 Features Revealed: Turing, CUDA Graphs and More](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/cuda-10-features-revealed/)

- overview of new features included in CUDA 10
- Multi-Precision Tensor Cores are exposed on Turing
- CUDA Graphs allow the specification and recording of an execution graph that can be executed multiple times, this reduces overhead and allows the compiler to apply further optimizations
- interoperability with Vulkan and D3D12 is supported
