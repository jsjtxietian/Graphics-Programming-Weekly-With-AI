2024: [[video] Explaining my game engine in 2024 - Part1: Triangle mesh tangent space, normal map identification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqRkwN3MxUI)

- the video provides a summary of how normal maps can be used to augment surface detail
- presents the derivation of the math that, such as tangent spaces, enables the augmentation
- additionally presents a method that can be used to approximately detect if a texture contains normal map information
