Unknown Date: [Hierarchical Depth Buffers](https://miketuritzin.com/post/hierarchical-depth-buffers/)

- the article presents what Hierarchical depth buffers are, what they are used for and how to generate them
- two different techniques for calculating these buffers are presented
- one pixel shader based method and a compute shader variation
- the compute shader variation is designed to only generate a single MIP level, not a full MIP chain
- presents a performance comparison between the two techniques
