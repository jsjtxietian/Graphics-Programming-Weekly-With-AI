2018-05-14: [Voxel DAGs and Multiresolution Hierarchies from large-scale scenes to pre-computed shadows](http://vic.crs4.it/eg2018-tutorial-voxels/)

- tutorial course covering representation, usage and applications of voxel DAG and multiresolution hierarchies
- voxel DAG take advantage of duplicated data found in voxel data sets
- how to
- compress color information
- construct a DAG using CUDA
- raytrace the structure
- use it for shadows in static environments
