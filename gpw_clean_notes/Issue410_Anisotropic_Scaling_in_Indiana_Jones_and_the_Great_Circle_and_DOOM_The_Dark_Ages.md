- The blog post discusses performance issues related to Anisotropic samples found on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, as well as DOOM
- presents an algorithm that can be used to vary AnisotropicSampleCount in a dynamic resolution scenario
- additionally brings up the option of using the same technique for values where infrequent change, particularly with a moving camera, may go unnoticed
