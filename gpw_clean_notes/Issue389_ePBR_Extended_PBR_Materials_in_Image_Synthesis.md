2025-04-28: [ePBR: Extended PBR Materials in Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17062v1)

- this paper introduces a framework that extends PBR materials to handle transparent surfaces like glass and windows
- addresses limitations of traditional reflection models that struggle with highly specular and transparent materials
- combines advantages of physically-based methods with efficiency by focusing on intrinsic image decomposition
- provides deterministic, interpretable control for material editing while maintaining physical plausibility
