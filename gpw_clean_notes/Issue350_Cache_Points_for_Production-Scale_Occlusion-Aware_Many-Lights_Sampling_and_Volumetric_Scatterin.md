2024-07-27: [Cache Points for Production-Scale Occlusion-Aware Many-Lights Sampling and Volumetric Scatterin](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3665320.3670993)

- This paper provides a deep dive into Disney's Hyperion Renderer's many-lights sampling system
- presents how it caches and interpolates light sampling distributions at points throughout space
- Presents how the approach allows the incorporation of learned visibility estimates into light sampling distributions
