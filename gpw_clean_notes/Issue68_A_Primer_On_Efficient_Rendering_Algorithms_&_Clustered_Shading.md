2019-01-12: [A Primer On Efficient Rendering Algorithms & Clustered Shading](http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/21/CG.html)

- explains how classical forward/deferred pipelines work and how tiled and clustered algorithms can be used to extend these ideas
- includes animations to show the concepts in a more visual way
- presents strengths and weaknesses for each technique  Part 2 of the article:
- presents the clustered forward shading implementation
- how to subdivide the camera frustum into clusters and implement light culling
- provides links to further information sources
