2023-05-12: [Stochastic Texture Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05810)

- the paper investigates and presents the quality and performance influence of stochastic texture filtering
- stochastic texture filtering makes it possible to perform filtering outside of the lighting integral
- this could allow for the adoption of higher-order texture magnification filters as  the introduced noise can be removed with temporal filtering algorithms
