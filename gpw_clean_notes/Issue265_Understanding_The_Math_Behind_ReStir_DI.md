- the in-depth article explains the mathematics behind the original ReStir and an in-depth analysis of why it works
- covers the preliminary knowledge required (Multiple)Importance Sampling, Sample Importance Resampling (SIR), Resampled Importance Sampling (RIS) as well, as Weighted Reservoir Sampling (WRS))
- uses the information to develop a mental framework for understanding ReStir (Reservoir Spatio-Temporal Importance Resampling), how it works and why it's an unbiased technique
