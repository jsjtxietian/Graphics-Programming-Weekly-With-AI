Unknown Date: [AMD FidelityFX Denoiser](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-Denoiser/blob/master/docs/FFX_Denoiser_Reflection_Technology.pdf)

- the presentation explains the ray tracing denoising technique developed by AMD
- shows what inputs are used, how the algorithm uses these to decide ray count, and how to use temporal reprojection to further reduce sample counts
- the code for the technique is provided, and the [website](https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-denoiser/) includes comparison pictures and images of the intermediate results
