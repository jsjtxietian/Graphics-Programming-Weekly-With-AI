2024-05-21: [A Fully-correlated Anisotropic Micrograin BSDF Model](https://hal.science/hal-04567402)

- the paper presents an improved version of a BSDF developed for micro grain materials
- shows how it explicitly models height-normal dependencies to summarize shadowing and masking inside the porous layer
