2020-04-27: [Ray Tracing Essentials Part 6: The Rendering Equation](https://news.developer.nvidia.com/ray-tracing-essentials-part-6-the-rendering-equation/)

- part of the ray tracing series covering the rendering equation
- breaks down the equations into components and explains the contributions to the final rendering result
- shows how pure path tracing is using the equation and techniques used to reduce the time required for the results to converge to the final result
