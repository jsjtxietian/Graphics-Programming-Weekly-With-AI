2021-03-21: [Stochastic-Depth Ambient Occlusion](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications-new/2021/VSE21/)

- the paper presents a novel approach to screen space ambient occlusion that accounts for occluded geometry through the use of a stochastic depth map
- Stochastic-Depth map is created through a global random that will discard pixels based on a tweakable cutoff value and store the results into separate samples per pixel
