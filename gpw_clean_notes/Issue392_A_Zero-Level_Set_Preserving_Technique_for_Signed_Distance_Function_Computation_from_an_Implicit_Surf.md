2025-05-16: [A Zero-Level Set Preserving Technique for Signed Distance Function Computation from an Implicit Surface](https://www.jcgt.org/published/0014/01/09/)

- presents a technique for computing signed distance functions (SDFs) from implicit surfaces
- ensures the shape of the surface is maintained during the conversion
- the proposed solution uses neural networks to minimize loss functions characterizing the SDF
