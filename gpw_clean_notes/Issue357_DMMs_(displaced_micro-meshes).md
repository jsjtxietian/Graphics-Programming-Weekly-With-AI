2024: [DMMs (displaced micro-meshes)](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/AnimatedDMMs.pdf)

- the paper presents a new method for the representation of skinned meshes with deformations for raytracing
- method allows for a compact representation of micro-triangle geometry through the hierarchical encoding of displacements
- shows how to animate base meshes and apply additional displaced movements on top
