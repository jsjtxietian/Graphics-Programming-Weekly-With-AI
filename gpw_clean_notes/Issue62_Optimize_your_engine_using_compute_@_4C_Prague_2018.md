2018-11-10: [Optimize your engine using compute @ 4C Prague 2018](https://gpuopen.com/optimize-engine-using-compute-4c-prague-2018/)

- overview of the compute shader execution and pipeline model
- explains how instructions are executed, what the difference between uniform and non-uniform work is and how it relates to SGPRs and VGPRs
- using the example of texture downsampling to present the performance profile of a pixel shader solution and why a compute shader solution can achieve better performance
