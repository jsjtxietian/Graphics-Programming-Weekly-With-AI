Unknown Date: [[video] An In-Depth look at Lerp, Smoothstep, and Shaping Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJB1QnEmlTs)

- the video presents visual explanations of lerp (linear interpolation)
- takes the knowledge to extend how to visualize and shape the curve for different effects
- presents standard functions and presents different use-cases
- it additionally shows cases where linear interpolation is not enough (camera movement, rotations, ..) and how to resolve them
