2020-05-25: [Accelerating Ray Tracing with Origin Offsets](https://github.com/jbikker/jbikker.github.io/blob/master/literature/Accelerating%20Ray%20Tracing%20with%20Origin%20Offsets%20-%202020.pdf)

- the paper proposed a new method that aims to improve ray tracing by offsetting ray starting point aways from the originating leaf nodes of the acceleration structures
- the suggested proposal is generating an auxiliary data structure of hemispheres that make it robust to offset the ray starting point
