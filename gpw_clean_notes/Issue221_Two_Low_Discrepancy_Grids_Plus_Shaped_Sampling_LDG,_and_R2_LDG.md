2022-02-07: [Two Low Discrepancy Grids: Plus Shaped Sampling LDG, and R2 LDG](https://blog.demofox.org/2022/02/01/two-low-discrepancy-grids-plus-shaped-sampling-ldg-and-r2-ldg/)

- the article discusses more noise distributions functions, presents grid-based noise definitions based on pixel positions alone
- shows the derivation of the noise function
- compares the function against White, Blue, Bayer, and more noise functions
- presents strengths and weaknesses of the distribution
