2024-06-23: [From microfacets to participating media: A unified theory of light transport with stochastic geometry](https://cs.dartmouth.edu/~wjarosz/publications/seyb24from.html)

- the paper presents a method that aims to unify microfacets and volumes for light transport purposes
- the paper shows that both can be expressed as stochastic implicit surfaces (SIS) and, more specifically, Gaussian process implicit surfaces (GPIS)
- discusses the derivation, representation generation, and tracing aspects of GPIS
- additionally discusses limitations regarding performance and quality
