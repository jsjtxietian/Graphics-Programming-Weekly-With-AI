2021-05-18: [Fast Divergence-Free Noise Generation in Shaders](https://atyuwen.github.io/posts/bitangent-noise/)

- the post presents a divergence-free noise generation technique (such as curl noise)
- the presented technique needs only 2 gradients (curl noise needs 3)
- shows how to optimize the technique and compares it to other noise types
