Unknown Date: [[video] Cloth Animation Using The Compute Shader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms010Fz02wo)

- the video tutorial implements a physics-based cloth simulation on the GPU using compute shaders
- discusses how to structure the mesh for connectivity as well as how to handle constraints solving to simulate springs
- covers both the theory as well as the implementation
