2025-05-07: [Boosting GPU Radix Sort performance: A memory-efficient extension to Onesweep with circular buffers](https://gpuopen.com/learn/boosting_gpu_radix_sort/)

- The blog post discusses GPU radix sort techniques
- Starting with a classical radix sort implementation and an overview of the improved onesweep implementation
- Explains how this technique can be extended to work within a fixed memory footprint through the use of a ring buffer for look-back storage
