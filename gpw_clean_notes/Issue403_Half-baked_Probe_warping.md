2025-08-11: [Half-baked: Probe warping](https://www.c0de517e.com/025_cubeproj.htm)

- explores a technique for "warping" probe data to approximate lighting information at different spatial locations
- describes an algorithm that uses planes and ray intersections to reproject cubemap data, similar to parallax mapping but applied to spherical probes
- presents a ShaderToy implementation that demonstrates the concepts
