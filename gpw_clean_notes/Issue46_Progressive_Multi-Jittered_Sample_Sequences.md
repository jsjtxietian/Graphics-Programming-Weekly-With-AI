2018-07-04: [Progressive Multi-Jittered Sample Sequences](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/ProgressiveMultiJitteredSampling/)

- introduction of new strategies to generate progressive(hierarchical) 2D sample point sequences
- can be stopped at any point in the sequence and samples will still be well distributed
- comparison against existing techniques, using many different distribution functions and shapes
