Unknown Date: [Direct Delta Mush Skinning Compression with Continuous Examples](https://www.ea.com/seed/news/ddm-compression-with-continuous-examples)

- the paper presents a novel model that splits a Direct Delta Mush into two layers
- this can approximate the deformation with improved runtime performance and lower memory requirement
- the video shows a comparison against other methods
- additionally presents performance numbers for the technique
