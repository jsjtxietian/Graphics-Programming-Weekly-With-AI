Unknown Date: [Procedural Physically based BRDF for Real-Time Rendering of Glints](http://igg.unistra.fr/People/chermain/real_time_glint/)

- the paper presents a physically-based model for the realtime rendering of sparkling materials
- the implementation uses a pre-computed BRDF dictionary of ~390KB size
- precomputation is independent of smoothness, so runtime variations are possible
