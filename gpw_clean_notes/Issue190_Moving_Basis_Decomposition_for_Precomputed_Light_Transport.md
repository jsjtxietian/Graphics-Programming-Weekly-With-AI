2021-01-27: [Moving Basis Decomposition for Precomputed Light Transport](https://arisilvennoinen.github.io/)

- paper presents the Moving Basis Decomposition framework
- this generalizes many existing basis expansion methods and efficient, seamless reconstruction of compressed data
- this is introduced as the foundation for a global illumination system
- compares the method against existing Blockwise PCA, Windowed blockwise PCA, and clustered PCA (PCA, Principal component analysis)
