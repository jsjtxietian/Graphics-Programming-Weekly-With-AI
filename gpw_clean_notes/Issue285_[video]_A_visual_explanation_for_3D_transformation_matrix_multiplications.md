2023: [[video] A visual explanation for 3D transformation matrix multiplications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftDb1cVcxN4)

- the video tutorial explains how matrices are combined
- visually explains the operations by explaining how a robotic arm transformation is implemented
- followed up by explaining how the multiplications are implemented mathematically but always visually explaining the relationships
