2022-12-07: [MIPNet: Neural Normal-to-Anisotropic-Roughness MIP Mapping](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/boubek/papers/MIPNet/index.html)

- the paper presents a new method to calculate texture MIP maps that preserves compatibility with existing MIP mapping techniques
- the technique uses neural networks to optimize the transfer of material appearance under varying view distances and lighting conditions
- presents the results on two distinct BRDF models (Anisotropic GGX and Anisotropic Beckmann)
