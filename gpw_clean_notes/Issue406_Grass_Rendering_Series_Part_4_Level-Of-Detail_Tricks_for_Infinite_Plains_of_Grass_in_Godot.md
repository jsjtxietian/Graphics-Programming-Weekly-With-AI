2025-08-27: [Grass Rendering Series Part 4: Level-Of-Detail Tricks for Infinite Plains of Grass in Godot](https://hexaquo.at/pages/grass-rendering-series-part-4-level-of-detail-tricks-for-infinite-plains-of-grass-in-godot/)

- presents techniques for implementing level-of-detail systems for grass rendering
- demonstrates the creation of grass impostors using custom shaders that replicate albedo, ambient occlusion, and normal maps without geometry
- shows how to implement smooth transitions between high-detail grass meshes and performance-optimized impostor representations
