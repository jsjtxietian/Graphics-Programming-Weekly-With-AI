2021-06-22: [NVIDIA Research: An Analytic BRDF for Materials with Spherical Lambertian Scatterers](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-research-an-analytic-brdf-for-materials-with-spherical-lambertian-scatterers/)

- the paper presents a new BRDF for porous/dusty materials
- these surfaces exhibit back-scattering and saturation that is missing from other BRDFs
- based on a volumetric BRDF derivation based spherical Lambertian particles
