2021-06-29: [NVIDIA Research: NeRF-Tex: Neural Reflectance Field Textures](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-research-nerf-tex-neural-reflectance-field-textures/)

- the presents the use of neural fields to model materials such as fur, fabric, and grass
- model a layer of mesoscale structure, such as fur or grass, on top of a triangle mesh using neural reflectance fields
- NeRF textures are volumetric textures that use neural nets instead of voxels
