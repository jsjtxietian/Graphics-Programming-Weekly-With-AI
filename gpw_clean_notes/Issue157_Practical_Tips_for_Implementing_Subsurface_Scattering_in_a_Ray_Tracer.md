- the article presents techniques to improve Subsurface Scattering (SSS) implementation based on the model used in [PBRT](https://www.pbrt.org)
- presents a basic overview, how to importance sample the model
- shows several improvements that aim to reduce Fireflies, optimize the implementation
- additionally covers the material system that allows blending between materials that have SSS influence and not
