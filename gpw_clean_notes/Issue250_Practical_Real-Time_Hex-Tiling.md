2022-08-28: [Practical Real-Time Hex-Tiling](https://jcgt.org/published/0011/03/05/)

- the paper introduces an adaptation of the Heitz and Neyret texture tiling technique
- the original technique required offline preprocessing to enable histogram-preserving tiling
- the new method removes the requirement and presents the implementation in shader code only
- presents how to apply the technique for color and normal maps
