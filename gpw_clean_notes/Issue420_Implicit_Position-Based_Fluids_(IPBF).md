- introduces a novel incompressible SPH scheme using second-order implicit descent
- demonstrates improved incompressibility and stability compared to velocity-based methods like IISPH and DFSPH
- remains unconditionally stable even for large time steps while avoiding the compression artifacts of standard position-based methods
