2018-05-06: [The implementation of Pixel-projected Screen Space Reflections](https://github.com/byumjin/Jin-Engine-2.1)

- explanation of the implementation of [Pixel Projected Reflections](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2017/PixelProjectedReflectionsAC_v_1.92.pdf) using vulkan
- supports approximation of normal maps and roughness
- comparison against brute force ray tracing implementation (image quality and performance)
