2021-07-19: [Reducing Acceleration Structure Memory with NVIDIA RTXMU](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/reducing-acceleration-structure-memory-with-nvidia-rtxmu/)

- the NVIDIA RTX Memory Utility is an open-source (MIT License) SDK designed for reducing the complexity of memory management for Raytracing on Vulkan and D3D12
- shows how to use the utility to integrate acceleration structure memory reduction techniques
- additionally presents how much memory can be saved on different scenes (very scene dependent)
