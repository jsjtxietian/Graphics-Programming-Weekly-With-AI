2025-02-04: [Sample for cluster-based continuous level of detail rasterization or ray tracing](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_lod_clusters)

- the sample is part of Nvidia RTX Mega Geometry and presents how to use a continuous Level of detail through mesh clustering
- presents how to rasterize using mesh shaders and use the new VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure for raytracing
- provided documentation provides a detailed walkthrough of the sample code and the underlying implementation
