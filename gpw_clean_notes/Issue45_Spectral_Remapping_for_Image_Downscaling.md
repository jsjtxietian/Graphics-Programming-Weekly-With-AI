2018-07-01: [Spectral Remapping for Image Downscaling](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/SpectralRemapping/)

- technique for downsampling images that preserves high-frequency information from the original image
- instead of discarding high-frequency information it remaps the signal into a form that can be represented in the downsampled image
