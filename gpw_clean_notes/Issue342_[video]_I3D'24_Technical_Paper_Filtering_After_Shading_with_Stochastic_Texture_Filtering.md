Unknown Date: [[video] I3D'24 Technical Paper: Filtering After Shading with Stochastic Texture Filtering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3391_C6aXE)

- extended presentation of the I3D paper presentation discussed last week
- the paper presents an investigation into applying texture filtering after shading instead of before shading
- shows comparisons of the approaches and a background into the underlying theory
- presents guidelines on the tradeoffs and when to use different approaches
