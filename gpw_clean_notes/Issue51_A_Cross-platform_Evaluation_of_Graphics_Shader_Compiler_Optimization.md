2018-08-13: [A Cross-platform Evaluation of Graphics Shader Compiler Optimization](https://hgpu.org/?p=18407)

- explores source to source optimizations techniques using the LunarGlass framework with GLSL shaders
- comparison of different optimization techniques and the effects on runtime performance
- results vary significantly between different shaders and target platforms
