2023-01-10: [Tangent Spaces and Diamond Encoding](https://www.jeremyong.com/graphics/2023/01/09/tangent-spaces-and-diamond-encoding/)

- the article provides an overview of Tangen Space Encodings
- covers how to use Octahedral Encoding and further compress it with Tangent Angle
- from there, develops the suggested Diamond Encoding technique that extends the Octahedral approach into the tangent angle space
- additionally provides a brief section on rethinking how tangent space encoding might be better expressed on a mesh(let) level on modern hardware
