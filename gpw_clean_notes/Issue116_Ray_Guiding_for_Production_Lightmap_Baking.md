2020-01-01: [Ray Guiding for Production Lightmap Baking](https://research.activision.com/publications/2020-01/ray-guiding-for-production-lightmap-baking)

- the paper introduces a technique for improving the computation time required for lightmap baking
- based on guided sampling and minimum variance-based estimator combination
- the method has a fixed memory footprint and is independent of scene complexity
