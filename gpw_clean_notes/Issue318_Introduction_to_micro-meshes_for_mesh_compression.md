- the article presents how to use Simplygon to generate micro-meshes (base structure + displacement information)
- shows examples of what kind of results can be expected from different settings and how it affects memory usage and quality
- presents how the way a model has been created can affect the base resolution vs. tesselation amount to achieve high-quality results
