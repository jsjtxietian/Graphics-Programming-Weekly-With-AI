2018-05-21: [A Multi-Faceted Exploration (Part 1)](http://blog.selfshadow.com/2018/05/13/multi-faceted-part-1/)

- start of series that will look at lack of multi scattering in common analytical BSDFs and solution
- only modelling single scattering causes significant energy loss on rough surfaces
- post shows visual example that up to 60% of energy can be lost
