2020: [Systematic Evaluation of the Quality Benefits of Spatiotemporal Sample Reprojection in Real-Time Stereoscopic Path Tracing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9144193)

- the paper presents an evaluation of what kind of gains can be achieved with temporal reprojection in a path tracer setting
- uses an SSIM (structural similarity index ) metric to relate spatially and temporally reprojected path traced image to a purely path traced image with similar quality
- provides data for multiple scenes and sample counts
