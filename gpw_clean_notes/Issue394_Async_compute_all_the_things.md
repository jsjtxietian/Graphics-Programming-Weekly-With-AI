2025-05-28: [Async compute all the things](https://interplayoflight.wordpress.com/2025/05/27/async-compute-all-the-things/)

- explores asynchronous compute techniques to improve GPU utilization by executing compute and graphics workloads in parallel
- explains the implementation details of scheduling work on separate command queues and synchronizing between them using fences
- provides practical examples of work pairing that benefits from async compute and how to measure performance gains
