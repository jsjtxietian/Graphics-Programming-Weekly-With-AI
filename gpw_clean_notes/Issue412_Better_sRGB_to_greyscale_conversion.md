2025-10-14: [Better sRGB to greyscale conversion](https://30fps.net/pages/better-srgb-to-greyscale/)

- presents an improved formula for converting sRGB colors to greyscale in gamma space
- explains why the standard Rec. 709 coefficients are technically incorrect when used with gamma-corrected values
- compares alternative coefficients optimized for nonlinear color space with visual examples
