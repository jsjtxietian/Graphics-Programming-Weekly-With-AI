2023-11-27: [Interpolating Color Image Histograms Using Sliced Optimal Transport](https://blog.demofox.org/2023/11/25/interpolating-color-image-histograms-using-sliced-optimal-transport/)

- the article provides a visual explanation of what an optimal transport problem is
- presents how the problem can be solved a lot simpler in 1D
- extends on this insight to present how a multi-dimensional problem can be sliced and approximated in multiple 1D steps
