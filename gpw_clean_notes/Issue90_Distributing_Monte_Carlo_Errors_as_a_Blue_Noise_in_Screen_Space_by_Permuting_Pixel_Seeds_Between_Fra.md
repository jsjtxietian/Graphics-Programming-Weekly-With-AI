2019-06-24: [Distributing Monte Carlo Errors as a Blue Noise in Screen Space by Permuting Pixel Seeds Between Frames](https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/772-2/)

- the paper builds on the techniques described in the previous article
- introduces a temporal algorithm that locally permutes the pixel sequences
- improves error distribution for a series of frames
