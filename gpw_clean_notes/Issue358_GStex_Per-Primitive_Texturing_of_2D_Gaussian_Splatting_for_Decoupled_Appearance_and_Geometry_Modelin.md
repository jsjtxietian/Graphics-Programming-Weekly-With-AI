2024-09-22: [GStex: Per-Primitive Texturing of 2D Gaussian Splatting for Decoupled Appearance and Geometry Modeling](https://lessvrong.com/cs/gstex/)

- the blog post introduces a technique to decouple the appearance and geometry of Gaussian
- the approach decouples appearance and geometry through the use of per-Gaussian texture maps
- presents a quality comparison against other Gaussian splatting techniques
