2022-04-01: [Software Rasterization of 2 Billion Points in Real Time](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2022/SCHUETZ-2022-PCC/)

- the paper presents an improvement of compute shader-based point cloud rasterization
- presents LoD structures for point clouds
- introduces the concept of per-batch Adaptive Vertex Precision that allows each batch to use three different position precisions relative to the center of the batch
