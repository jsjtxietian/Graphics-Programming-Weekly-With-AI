2022-08-22: [CoG 2022: Automatic Testing and Validation of LoD Reductions Through Supervised Learning](https://www.ea.com/seed/news/cog22-lod-reduction-supervised-learning)

- the paper introduces two convolutional neural networks (CNN) based techniques that can detect LOD transitions and the quality of that transition
- two models are presented to solve these two issues separately
- discusses the issue with the current approaches and how the presented techniques could be used to support artists
