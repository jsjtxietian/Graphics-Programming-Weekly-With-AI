2024-02-15: [Collaborative Control for Geometry-Conditioned PBR Image Generation](https://unity-research.github.io/holo-gen/)

- The paper introduces a machine learning model that generates a set of PBR Textures (albedo, Roughness, Metallic)
- trained on a locked RGB model to take advantage of existing models
- discusses how the model was designed, tradeoffs, and common failure cases
