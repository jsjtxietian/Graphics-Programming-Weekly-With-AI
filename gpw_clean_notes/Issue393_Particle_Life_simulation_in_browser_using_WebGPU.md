- implements a WebGPU-based particle simulation that creates emergent life-like behaviors through asymmetric attraction/repulsion forces
- describes optimization techniques like spatial binning and parallel prefix sum for computing inter-particle forces efficiently
- discusses rendering approaches with anti-aliasing for both large and sub-pixel particles with glow effects
