2025-05-26: [SOBB: Skewed Oriented Bounding Boxes for Ray Tracing](https://dcgi.fel.cvut.cz/projects/sobb/)

- introduces Skewed Oriented Bounding Boxes (SOBB) for ray tracing acceleration
- presents an efficient algorithm for transforming standard AABB BVHs into SOBB representations
- demonstrates performance improvements of 1.0-11.0x over AABB BVH and 1.1x over OBB BVH for secondary rays, with similar memory requirements to AABBs
