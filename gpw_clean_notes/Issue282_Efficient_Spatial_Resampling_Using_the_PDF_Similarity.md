Unknown Date: [Efficient Spatial Resampling Using the PDF Similarity](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/Efficient_Spatial_Resampling_Using_the_PDF_Similarity.pdf)

- the paper introduces a new rejection method based on the PDF shape similarity between pixels for single-bounce ReSTIR
- this helps to reduce spatial resampling across shadow edges and material boundaries
