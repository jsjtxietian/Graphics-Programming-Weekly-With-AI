2023-01-12: [Approximate projected bounds](https://zeux.io/2023/01/12/approximate-projected-bounds/)

- the article shows techniques implement conservative techniques to project bounding boxes and spheres into screen-space
- these techniques are optimized for use in culling use cases as it affects the meaning of near-z clipping
- presents trade-offs between the techniques in terms of computational cost and culling efficiency
