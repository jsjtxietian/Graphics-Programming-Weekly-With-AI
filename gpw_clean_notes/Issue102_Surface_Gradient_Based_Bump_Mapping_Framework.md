2019-10-14: [Surface Gradient Based Bump Mapping Framework](https://unity.com/labs/publications#surface-gradient-based-bump-mapping-framework-2019)

- a mathematical framework for more consistent layering of bump/normal maps using linear surface gradients
- shows the problems with reliance on vertex level tangent space in existing techniques
- how to express existing methods in the new framework
- including source code
