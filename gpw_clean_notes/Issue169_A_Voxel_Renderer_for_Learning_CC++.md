- the article provides an overview of a GPU voxel renderer using raytracing
- shows the data structure layout, how GPU and CPU updates are overlapped
- presents a technique to archive interactive world updates by using incremental parallel updates
- additionally offers advice to improve the performance of the multi-threaded implementation
