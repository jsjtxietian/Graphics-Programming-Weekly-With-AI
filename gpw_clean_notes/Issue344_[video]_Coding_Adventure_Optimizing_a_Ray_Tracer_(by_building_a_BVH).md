2024: [[video] Coding Adventure: Optimizing a Ray Tracer (by building a BVH)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1H4zIiCOaI)

- the video explains the concept of a BVH (bounding volume hierarchy) and presents how it increases the performance of a raytracing implementation
- shows a detailed explanation and many visualizations of the behavior of the data structure and how to build an efficient implementation
- presents different heuristics that can be used to order the data for efficient access
- shows the results and presents performance improvements
