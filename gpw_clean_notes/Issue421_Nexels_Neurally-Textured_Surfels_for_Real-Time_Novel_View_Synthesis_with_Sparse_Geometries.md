2025-12-17: [Nexels: Neurally-Textured Surfels for Real-Time Novel View Synthesis with Sparse Geometries](https://lessvrong.com/cs/nexels/)

- presents a novel representation combining surfels with neural texturing for view synthesis
- achieves quality matching 3D Gaussian splatting using 9.7x fewer primitives on outdoor scenes
- aims to improve render times compared to existing methods by selectively texturing high-weight samples
