2021: [Data-Driven Analysis and Design of Vulkan Ray-Tracing Applications using Automatic Instrumentation](https://hgpu.org/?p=25106)

- the master thesis presents a SPIR-V based instrumentation framework
- shows how to use instrumentation to gather information about the execution of ray tracing shaders
- additionally presents RayScope, a system for the visualization of collected instrumentation data
- shows examples of problems that the system helped to identify
