2024-11-25: [TinyDiffRast project](https://jjbannister.github.io/tinydiffrast/)

- educational course implementing differentiable triangle rasterization from scratch inspired by tiny renderer
- teaches inverse rendering techniques allowing 3D scene parameters to be learned from 2D images through gradient-based optimization
- covers automatic differentiation, discontinuity handling, and practical applications including optimizing geometry, materials, lighting, and camera parameters
