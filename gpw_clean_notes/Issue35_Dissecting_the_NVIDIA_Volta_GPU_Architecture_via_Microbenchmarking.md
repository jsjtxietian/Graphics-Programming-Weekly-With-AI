2018-04-22: [Dissecting the NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture via Microbenchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06826)

- microarchitectural details of the NVIDIA Volta architecture
- registers are divided into two 64 bit banks
- reduction of bank conflicts with register remapping can improve performance by 15%
- shorter latency for shared memory atomics
