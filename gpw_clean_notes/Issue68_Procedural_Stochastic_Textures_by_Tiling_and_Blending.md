2019-01-12: [Procedural Stochastic Textures by Tiling and Blending](https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/738-2/)

- preprint of the article to appear in GPU Zen 2 talking about the implementation details (C++ and GLSL)
- replaces the 3D histogram transformation with three 1D histogram transformations
- improves quality of the result under mipmapping and shows how to generate correct results with compressed texture formats
