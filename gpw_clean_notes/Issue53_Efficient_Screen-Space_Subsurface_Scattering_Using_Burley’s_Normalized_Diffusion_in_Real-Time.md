2018-08-27: [Efficient Screen-Space Subsurface Scattering Using Burley’s Normalized Diffusion in Real-Time](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2018/Efficient%20screen%20space%20subsurface%20scattering%20Siggraph%202018.pdf)

- presentation of a screen space subsurface scattering model, they call it the Disney SSS
- model is using a single tweakable parameter that makes it easy to use for artists
- implementation details for a thick and thin object model and optimizations to the implementation
