2025-12-16: [Sample Space Partitioning and Spatiotemporal Resampling for Specular Manifold Sampling](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/psms-restir/)

- extends Specular Manifold Sampling for interactive caustic rendering using tile-based sample space partitioning
- restricts expensive Newton iterations to the vicinity of seed paths by building per-frame prior distributions
- applies ReSTIR spatiotemporal resampling to amortize sample generation costs and achieve variance reduction
