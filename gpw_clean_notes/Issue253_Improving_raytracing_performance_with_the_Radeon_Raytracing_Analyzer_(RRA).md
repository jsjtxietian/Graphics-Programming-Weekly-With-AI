2022-09-16: [Improving raytracing performance with the Radeon Raytracing Analyzer (RRA)](https://gpuopen.com/learn/improving-rt-perf-with-rra/)

- the post provides insights into ray tracing BVH performance
- shows how splitting BVHs, usage of instances, BVH splitting, and model creation can affect performance
- the effect of deformations on update vs. rebuild
- additionally presents a comparison of iterative and recursive ray tracing
