2018-07-27: [View-warped Multi-view Soft Shadowing for Local Area Lights](http://jcgt.org/published/0007/03/01/)

- shadow technique for local area lights
- based on the generation of view independent point clouds from dynamic triangle meshes and the rendering of multiple depth maps simultaneously
- proposes two different implementations
- performance and quality comparison against PCSS (percentage closer soft shadows) and Multi-view rasterization (MVR)
