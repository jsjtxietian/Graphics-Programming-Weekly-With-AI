2021-01-28: [Improved Shader and Texture Level of Detail Using Ray Cones](http://jcgt.org/published/0010/01/01/)

- the paper introduces a new method for Mip level selection, including anisotropic filtering in a raytracer
- presented technique is not based on screen space derivatives
- extends the technique to apply to textures with different dimensions
- shows how ray cones can be used to select LOD for shading too
