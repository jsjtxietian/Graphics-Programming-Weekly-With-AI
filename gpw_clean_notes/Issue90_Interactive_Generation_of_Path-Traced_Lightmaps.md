2019-06-24: [Interactive Generation of Path-Traced Lightmaps](http://torust.me/thesis)

- a master thesis that describes a progressively path-traced solution for indirect illumination lightmaps on the GPU
- covers parameterizing geometry into lightmaps, improving coherence in a path tracer, reducing variance and spherical basis functions
- presents a new way to store diffuse and specular irradiance using an Ambient Dice encoding scheme (additional post below)
