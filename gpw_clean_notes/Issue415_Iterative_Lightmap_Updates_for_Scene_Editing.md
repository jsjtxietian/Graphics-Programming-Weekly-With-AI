- Pacific Graphics 2025 paper presenting an iterative algorithm to update lightmaps when objects are inserted or removed efficiently
- focuses on updating only the paths affected by scene changes rather than full recomputation
- implements an importance sampling scheme on a GPU suitable for interactive scene editing scenarios
