- In the working document, Timothy Lottes records and suggests solutions for GPU programming issues in a compute shader context
- covers many problematic areas, from performance hints over shader compiler improvements, caching related, buffer access patterns, and much more
- provides example cases that offer insights into current shortcomings, performance issues, and shader compiler bugs
