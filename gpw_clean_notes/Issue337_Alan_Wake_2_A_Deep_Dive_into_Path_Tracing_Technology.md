2024-04-29: [Alan Wake 2: A Deep Dive into Path Tracing Technology](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gdc24-gdc1003/?playlistId=playList-821861a9-571a-4073-abab-d60ece4d1e49)

- the video presentation (free login required) discusses the implementation details of Path Tracing within the Alan Wake 2 technology stack
- starts with an overview of the implementation used (vertex accessing, BVH creation, dealing with dynamic geometry, etc.)
- shows how Opacity Micromaps are used for alpha-tested geometry
- from there, explain how Path tracing has been implemented, covering the whole pipeline from shading, shadows, reflections, and reconstruction techniques
