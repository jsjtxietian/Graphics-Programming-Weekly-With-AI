2018-07-01: [Gradient Estimation for Real-Time Adaptive Temporal Filtering](http://cg.ivd.kit.edu/atf.php)

- a technique that adjusts the temporal accumulation factor dynamically per pixel and frame
- done by calculating per-pixel temporal gradients. These are reconstructed from sparse information that captures the change of luminance between the last and current frame
