Unknown Date: [Towards Practical Meshlet Compression](https://diglib.eg.org/items/423fd6b9-d226-4e82-92a0-4856bc064bdf)

- the paper proposes a codec designed explicitly for meshlet compression within a mesh shader
- presents how to find optimal generalized triangle strips on meshlets
- discusses the lossless compression schema for index data
- additionally presents a crack-free quantization for vertex attributes
- performance results are presented, and the code is available
