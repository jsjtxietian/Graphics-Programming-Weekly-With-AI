2025-07-11: [Lossless Float Image Compression](https://aras-p.info/blog/2025/07/08/Lossless-Float-Image-Compression/)

- compares lossless compression techniques for multi-layer floating point images
- evaluates OpenEXR, JPEG-XL, and a custom approach using mesh optimizer with zstd
- presents that mesh optimizer combined with zstd provides really good performance-to-compression ratio results
