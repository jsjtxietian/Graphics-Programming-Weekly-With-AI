- the article presents the definition of a physically-based material that is energy conservation and reciprocity
- reciprocity is essential to be able to use bi-directional path tracing techniques
- looks at common methods such as Pre-Filtered Environment Maps, several Dielectric Material implementations presenting if they are reciprocal and/or energy-conserving and explaining why
