Unknown Date: [Denoising-Aware Adaptive Sampling for Monte Carlo Ray Tracing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3588432.3591537)

- The paper proposes an adaptive sampling technique for efficient Monte Carlo rendering with deep-learning-based denoising
- The suggested method estimates the variance of neural network outputs with random inputs to drive adaptive sampling methods
- When combined with denoising post-correction, it significantly accelerates error convergence during rendering
