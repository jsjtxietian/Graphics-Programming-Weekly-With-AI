2018-10-22: [Improving material system](https://sergeyreznik.github.io/metal-ray-tracer/part-3-2/index.html)

- extending the material system of the Metal raytracer so that multiple materials can be expressed and importance sampled correctly
- changes sampling heuristic to support multiple importance sampling. This enables both rough and mirror-like surfaces
