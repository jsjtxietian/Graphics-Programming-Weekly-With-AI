2024-11-20: [Efficient Motion Blurred Spheres Using Texture Mapping](https://jcgt.org/published/0013/02/01/)

- the paper presents a model of applying motion blur to spheres in a 2.5D setting
- implemented by pre-generating an atlas of blurred spheres of varying radius and lighting angles and compositing these into the scene
- explains the implementation and limitations
- runnable example and source code is provided
