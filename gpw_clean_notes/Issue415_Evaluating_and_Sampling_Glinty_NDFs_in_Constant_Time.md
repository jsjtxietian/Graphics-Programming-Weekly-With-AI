2025-11-04: [Evaluating and Sampling Glinty NDFs in Constant Time](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/boubek/papers/Glinty/)

- SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 paper presenting a method for rendering glint effects from microfacet geometry in constant time
- represents faceted geometry as a 4D point process on a multiscale grid to find highlight-causing facets efficiently
- supports various appearances, including anisotropic materials and individually colored particles, while converging to standard NDFs like GGX
