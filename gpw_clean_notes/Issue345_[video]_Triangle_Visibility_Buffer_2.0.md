2024: [[video] Triangle Visibility Buffer 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWLev9CoQdg&t=8s)

- the talk provides an overview of the experimental Triangle Visibility Buffer 2.0 implementation
- The presented approach uses only compute shaders to write the visibility buffer
- discusses the pipeline design, different approaches based on triangle sizes, and how performance compares
- additionally presents which features are still missing compared to hardware rasterization
