2022-02-11: [In the works: HLSL Shader Model 6.7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/in-the-works-hlsl-shader-model-6-7/)

- the blog post presents the new features of shader model 6.7
- improved texture operations such as Raw Gather (unmodified retrieval of the 4 samples from bilinear sampling)
- writable MSAA textures, quad-level operations
- additionally introduces programmable offsets for load and store from runtime variables instead of compile-time constants
