- the author presents a discussion of how to apply software rasterizing to the problem of hair rendering
- technique is based on the Frostbite technique from the presentation "Every Strand Counts: Physics and Rendering Behind Frostbite's Hair"
- discusses the implementation of the steps that make up the technique, such as spline projection, rasterization using edge functions, as well as interpolation information along the strands
- WebGPU demo and implementation is available
