2023-10-24: [[pdf] Bounded VNDF Sampling for Smith–GGX Reflections](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/Bounded_VNDF_Sampling_for_Smith-GGX_Reflections.pdf)

- the paper introduces a method to reduce the amount of rejected rays for tracing rays following a visible normal distribution function (VNDF)
- the unbiased method improves variance for highly rough and low-anisotropy surfaces
