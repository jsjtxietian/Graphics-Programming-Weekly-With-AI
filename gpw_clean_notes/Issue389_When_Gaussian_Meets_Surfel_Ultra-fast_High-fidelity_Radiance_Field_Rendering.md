2025-04-25: [When Gaussian Meets Surfel: Ultra-fast High-fidelity Radiance Field Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17545)

- this research introduces Gaussian-enhanced Surfels (GESs), combining 2D opaque surfels for coarse geometry with 3D Gaussians for fine details
- the novel two-pass rendering approach is entirely sorting-free, eliminating the computational bottleneck of Gaussian sorting
- achieves both ultra-fast frame rates and avoids the popping artifacts commonly seen in other real-time radiance field rendering methods
- includes extensions like Mip-GES for anti-aliasing, Speedy-GES for faster rendering, and 2D-GES for compact storage
