- the paper introduces models to solve the reconstruction of irradiance in the vertex-normal space
- applies the developed framework to hemispherical and cone occlusion to volumetric lighting
- as well as mitigating light leakage for normal-mapped surfaces' appearance of runtime ambient occlusion
- shadertoy implementation is provided
