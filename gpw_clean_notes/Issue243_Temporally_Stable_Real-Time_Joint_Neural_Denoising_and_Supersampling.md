2022-07-10: [Temporally Stable Real-Time Joint Neural Denoising and Supersampling](https://momentsingraphics.de/HPG2022.html)

- the paper presents a neural network architecture that allows both denoising and supersampling to be applied as part of a single network
- this is achieved by sharing a joint feature extractor
- discusses the different stages of the network, what inputs are required and how they interact
- presents a comparison against existing solutions and offers performance numbers
