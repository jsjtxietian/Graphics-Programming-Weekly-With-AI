2022-07-04: [Planetary Shadow-Aware Distance Sampling](https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/sr20221152)

- the paper introduces a visibility-aware transmittance sampling technique for rendering atmospheric scattering
- this is achieved by adjusting the sample locations along the view vector past the shadow boundary so that all samples contribute meaningful data
- compares the solutions against others and presents cases where the proposed solution is not able to improve
- it additionally provides an example of a CPU implementation
