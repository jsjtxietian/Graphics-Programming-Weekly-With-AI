2024-07-22: [Real-Time Procedural Generation with GPU Work Graphs](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/Real-Time_Procedural_Generation_with_GPU_Work_Graphs-GPUOpen_preprint.pdf)

- the paper presents a detailed look at how to use D3D12 work graphs to generate a procedural world
- shows how multiple generation phases are combined with GPU ray-tracing to create a world
- discusses how the BVH structure is used to place markers, generate Ivy, marketplace arrangements, as well as ground clutter
- presents results with performance information
