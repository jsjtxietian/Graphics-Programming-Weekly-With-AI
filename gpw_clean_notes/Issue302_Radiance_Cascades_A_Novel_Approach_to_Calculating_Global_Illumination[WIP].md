2023-08-28: [Radiance Cascades: A Novel Approach to Calculating Global Illumination[WIP]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6v1_7HY2X-LV3Ofb6oyTIxgEaP4LOI6/view)

- The paper presents a global illumination technique based on radiance cascades
- Radiance Casdaces allow the storing and calculating of radiance fields by decomposing them into multiple ranges (from near-field to far-field) with asymptotic scaling
- The paper discusses the data structure, implementation, and how the presented technique is used in Path of Exile 2
