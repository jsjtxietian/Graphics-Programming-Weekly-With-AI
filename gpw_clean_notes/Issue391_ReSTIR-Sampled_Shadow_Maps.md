2025-05-12: [ReSTIR-Sampled Shadow Maps](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/restir-shadow-maps/)

- The paper combines ReSTIR (Reservoir-based Spatio-Temporal Importance Resampling) with shadow mapping for complex lighting
- the selection strategy generates shadow maps for lights with the strongest contributions to pixels in the current camera view
- and falls back to imperfect shadow maps to provide low-resolution shadow approximations
