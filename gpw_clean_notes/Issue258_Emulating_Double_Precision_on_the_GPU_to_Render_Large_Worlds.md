Unknown Date: [Emulating Double Precision on the GPU to Render Large Worlds](https://godotengine.org/article/emulating-double-precision-gpu-render-large-worlds)

- the article presents that the Godot engine supports compilation in double-precision mode
- shows how to emulate double precision calculation on GPUs that don't support double by using two floats
- presents what limitations still exist with this solution
