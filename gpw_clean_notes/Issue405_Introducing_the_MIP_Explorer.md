2025-08-25: [Introducing the MIP Explorer](https://haukethiessen.com/introducing-the-mip-explorer/)

- Python tool for analyzing texture resolution requirements by examining mipmap level information distribution
- calculates per-pixel differences between consecutive mip levels to identify needlessly large textures
- helps to optimize texture memory usage and streaming performance by providing objective metrics for size reduction decisions
