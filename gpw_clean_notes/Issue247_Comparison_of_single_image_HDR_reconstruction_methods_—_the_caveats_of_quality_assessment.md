2022-08-07: [Comparison of single image HDR reconstruction methods — the caveats of quality assessment](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/sihdr_benchmark/)

- the paper presents that common image metrics are not a great metric to detect the subjective quality of HDR reconstruction methods
- shows that only significant changes in metric results are likely to be an improvement
- suggests that color shifts are more noticeable to the human perception system than most metrics
