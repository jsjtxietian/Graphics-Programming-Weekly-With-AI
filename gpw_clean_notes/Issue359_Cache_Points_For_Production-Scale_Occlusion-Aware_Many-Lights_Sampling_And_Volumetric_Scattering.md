2024-09-29: [Cache Points For Production-Scale Occlusion-Aware Many-Lights Sampling And Volumetric Scattering](https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/cachepoints.html)

- the paper presents an  in-depth description of a system for guiding direct light sampling of scenes with hundreds of thousands of lights
- describes how the system can use online learning of visibility estimates and how it's used for accelerating volumetric scattering cases
- additionally provides insights into the production experience and limitations
