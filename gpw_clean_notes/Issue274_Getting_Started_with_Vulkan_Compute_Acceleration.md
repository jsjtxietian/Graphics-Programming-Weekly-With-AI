2023-02-13: [Getting Started with Vulkan Compute Acceleration](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Compute_Shader)

- the tutorial explains the basics of compute shader usage with Vulkan by implementing a compute-shader-based particle system
- shows how to load compute shaders, bind resources and interact with graphics resources
- additionally covers how the hardware executes compute shaders by explaining concepts such as workgroups and invocations
