2022-04-18: [Permutation Coding for Vertex-Blend Attribute Compression](https://momentsingraphics.de/I3D2022.html)

- the paper presents a new approach to compressing vertex data at a fixed bit-rate
- the paper presents error analysis, compares against existing solutions in terms of prevision and performance
- up to 13 per-vertex skinning weights can be compressed into 64bits with included code
