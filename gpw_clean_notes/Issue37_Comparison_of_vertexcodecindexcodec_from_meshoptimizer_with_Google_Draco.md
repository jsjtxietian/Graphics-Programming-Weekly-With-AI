2018-05-06: [Comparison of vertexcodec/indexcodec from meshoptimizer with Google Draco](https://gist.github.com/zeux/b48678a44944187c16f55ad6cca45e78)

- comparison of Draco and mesh optimizer output in regards to size and decoding time
- Draco size compression is mesh dependent, can be larger. Always a lot slower to decode
