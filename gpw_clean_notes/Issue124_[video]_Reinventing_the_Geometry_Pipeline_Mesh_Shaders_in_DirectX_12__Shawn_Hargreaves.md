- the presentation provides an overview of mesh shaders
- explains the problem with the classical geometry pipeline and how the mesh shader pipeline is an improvement
- provides a walkthrough of code demonstrating how mesh shaders are implemented and what needs to be considered to achieve excellent performance
- explains the meshlet data structure and how to use this as a base for a mesh shader pipeline
- how to implement instancing, and using per-primitive attributes
