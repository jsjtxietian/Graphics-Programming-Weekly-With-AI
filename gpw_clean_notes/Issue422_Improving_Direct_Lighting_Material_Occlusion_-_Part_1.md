2025-12-27: [Improving Direct Lighting Material Occlusion - Part 1](https://irradiance.ca/posts/microshadowing-part1/)

- analyzes limitations of traditional micro-occlusion texture baking for material-level direct lighting occlusion
- compares micro-shadowing approaches from Naughty Dog and Activision with analytical formulas and visual results
- proposes improved analytical alternative using cone angle calculations with better handling of full occlusion and roughness variation
