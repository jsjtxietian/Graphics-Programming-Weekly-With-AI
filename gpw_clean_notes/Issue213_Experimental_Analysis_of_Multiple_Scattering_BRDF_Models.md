2021-12-08: [Experimental Analysis of Multiple Scattering BRDF Models](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~ppeers/showPublication.php?id=Xie%3A2021%3AEAM)

- the paper presents an analysis of multiple scattering BRDF models
- shows the microfacet distribution function is most important for smooth materials
- shadowing and masking term increases with roughness
- shows how a mix of lambert and GGX can approximate a large number of materials
