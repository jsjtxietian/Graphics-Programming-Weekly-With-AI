- the article presents an overview of 10 aspects to consider when approaching solving a computer graphics problem
- discusses the importance of understanding the working space, data representation, as well as time constraints
- presents how to take advantage of generic data science techniques (such as data visualization/exploration, Numerical optimization, ...) to gain new insights
- additionally shows how ground truth and Machine learning techniques can be combined to develop an intuition of the limits of a given solution
