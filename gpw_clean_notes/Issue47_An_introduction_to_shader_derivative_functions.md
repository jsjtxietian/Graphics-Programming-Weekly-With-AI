2018-07-13: [An introduction to shader derivative functions](http://www.aclockworkberry.com/shader-derivative-functions/)

- explanation of partial derivates in pixels shader, (ddx, ddy in HLSL or dFdx, dFdy in OpenGL)
- the rate of change for variables in a 2x2 pixel grid
- how they are calculated, how they can be used to calculate face normals from world space positions
- how branches interact with derivative calculations
