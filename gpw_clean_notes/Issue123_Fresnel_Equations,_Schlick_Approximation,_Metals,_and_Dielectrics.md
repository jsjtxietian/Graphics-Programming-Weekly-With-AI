2020-03-14: [Fresnel Equations, Schlick Approximation, Metals, and Dielectrics](http://psgraphics.blogspot.com/2020/03/fresnel-equations-schlick-approximation.html)

- the post presents the fresnel equations that are used for smooth metals and surfaces such as water
- shows the Schlick approximations and compares them to the equations and where to retrieve the necessary parameter values
