- the article discusses how to compress the data for the Gaussian Splats technique for reduced memory usage
- presents how to re-order data for spatial coherence, compressing data relative to a local reference point
- discusses how to compress splat data as textures and the effect of different BC compressions on the visual quality and memory reduction
