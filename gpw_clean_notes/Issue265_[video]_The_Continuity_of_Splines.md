Unknown Date: [[video] The Continuity of Splines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds)

- the detailed video explains splines and concepts derived/extended from these
- covering Bézier Curves and Bézier Splines, explaining the underlying mathematics and concepts
- provides an in-depth explanation of the concepts of continuity, yet again in a large number of contexts
- with this information, the video dives deeper into extended concepts such as Hermite Spline, B-Spline, NURBS, and color splines (to name a few)
