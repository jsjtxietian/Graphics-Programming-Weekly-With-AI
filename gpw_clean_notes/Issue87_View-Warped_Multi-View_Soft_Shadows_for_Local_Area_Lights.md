2019-06-01: [View-Warped Multi-View Soft Shadows for Local Area Lights](http://www.visualextract.com/talks/i3d19-view-warped-soft-shadows/)

- new point based shadowing algorithm for local area lights
- better quality than single view and less performance required than multi-view solutions
- generate a multi-viewpoint pointset for the area light
- projecting points into many depth buffers at once
