2019-06-24: [Glint Rendering based on a Multiple-Scattering Patch BRDF](http://www.unilim.fr/pages_perso/xavier.chermain/ms_glints/)

- new glint integrator for specular surfaces using multiple-scattering patch-based BRDF
- addresses energy loss introduced from classical normal mapping
- uses normal maps and second moments of slopes as in [LEADR mapping](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00858220v1/document)
