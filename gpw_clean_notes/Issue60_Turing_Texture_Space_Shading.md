2018-10-28: [Turing Texture Space Shading](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/texture-space-shading/)

- overview of texture space shading
- technique decouples shading from rasterization rate
- Turing hardware provides support for computing derivatives in compute shaders and exposes texels that need to be shaded
- linked video explains the implementation of a texel space shading pipeline
