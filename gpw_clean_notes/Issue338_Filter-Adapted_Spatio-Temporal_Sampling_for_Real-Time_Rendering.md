2024-05-02: [Filter-Adapted Spatio-Temporal Sampling for Real-Time Rendering](https://www.ea.com/seed/news/spatio-temporal-sampling)

- the paper presents a framework to shape rendering noise to optimize samples for perceptual quality and denoising performance
- shows how sampling patterns can be optimized to take advantage of knowledge about post-processing spatial and temporal filtering characteristics
- demonstrates how to use the framework on example applications
