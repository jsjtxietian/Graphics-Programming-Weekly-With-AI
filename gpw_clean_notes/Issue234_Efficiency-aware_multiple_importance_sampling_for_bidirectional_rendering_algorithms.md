2022-05-04: [Efficiency-aware multiple importance sampling for bidirectional rendering algorithms](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/publications/grittmann-sig2022.html)

- the paper presents a method to adapt the set of sampling techniques in multi importance sampling to an input scene automatically
- the aim is to remove the need for manual tweaking of distributions
- based on a scheme for estimating the second moments of different sample allocation strategies
