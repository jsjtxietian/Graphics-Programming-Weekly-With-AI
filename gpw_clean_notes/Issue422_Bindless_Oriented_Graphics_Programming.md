- advocates for bindless rendering as an accessible gateway to GPU-driven rendering with lowered complexity
- demonstrates how bindless resources enable event-driven draw management with reduced CPU involvement
- proposes treating GPU data as database tables with compute shaders only modifying tables for simplified renderer architecture
