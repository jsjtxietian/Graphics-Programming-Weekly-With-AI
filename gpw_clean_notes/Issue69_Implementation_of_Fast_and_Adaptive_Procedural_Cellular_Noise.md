2019-01-21: [Implementation of Fast and Adaptive Procedural Cellular Noise](http://jcgt.org/published/0008/01/02/)

- cellular noise created from a quadtree grid structure
- presents a method that calculates the optimal order in which neighboring cells need to be visited in 2D
- introduces how to generalize this into higher dimensions and provides a python script can generate lookup tables to store the optimal visit order
- the technique reduces computation time by around 15%
