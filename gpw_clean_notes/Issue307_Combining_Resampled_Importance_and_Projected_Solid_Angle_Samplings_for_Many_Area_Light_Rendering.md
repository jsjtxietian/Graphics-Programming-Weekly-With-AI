2023-10-02: [Combining Resampled Importance and Projected Solid Angle Samplings for Many Area Light Rendering](https://ishaanshah.github.io/risltc/)

- The paper presents a combination of Resampled Importance Sampling (RIS) and Projected Solid Angle Sampling (ProjLTC) for many area lights.
- provides a method of improving the efficiency run-time as RIS with a lower error
- shows the comparison between previous methods
