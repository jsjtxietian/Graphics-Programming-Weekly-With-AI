0010-02-02: [Stable Geometric Specular Antialiasing with Projected-Space NDF Filtering](http://www.jcgt.org/published/0010/02/02/)

- the paper introduces an improvement for specular antialiasing
- normals distribution function (NDF) is filtered in orthographically projected space instead of slope space
- presents an approximation solution and provide source code
- additionally presents an isotropic NDF-filtering technique for deferred and forward rendering
