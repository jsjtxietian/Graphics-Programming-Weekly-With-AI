2024-04-24: [GPU Compute in the Browser at the Speed of Native: WebGPU Marching Cubes](https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2024/04/22/webgpu-marching-cubes)

- the article explains how to implement a marching cube compute shader
- the implementation is shown both in Vulkan and WebGPU
- compares the performance of both implementations and finds that WebGPU performance is close to native Vulkan
