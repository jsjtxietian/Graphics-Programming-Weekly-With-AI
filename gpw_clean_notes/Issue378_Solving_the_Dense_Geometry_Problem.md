2025-02-07: [Solving the Dense Geometry Problem](https://gpuopen.com/learn/problem_increasing_triangle_density/)

- This blog post introduces the release of the AMD Dense Geometry Compression Format SDK
- The format aims to be the equivalent to what BC/ETC is for textures but instead for geometry
- Explains limitations of the current solution and how the format aims to overcome it
- The SDK contains how to compress, view, and decompress the data (both on the CPU and GPU)
