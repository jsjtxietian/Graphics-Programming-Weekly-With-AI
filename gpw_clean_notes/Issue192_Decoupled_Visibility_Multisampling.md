- presents a method that decouples geometry samples from shading samples
- explains the difference of human vision between the ability to detect edge aliasing and internal aliasing and why geometric frequency is required to be higher
- explains performance implication of triangle sizes and MSAA
- shows how TAA, MSAA, and Decoupled Visibility Multisampling (DMV) compare in performance and quality
