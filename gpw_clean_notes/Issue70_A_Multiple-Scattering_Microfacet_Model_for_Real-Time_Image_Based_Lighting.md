2019-01-28: [A Multiple-Scattering Microfacet Model for Real-Time Image Based Lighting](http://www.jcgt.org/published/0008/01/03/)

- extension to real-time image based lighting models
- adding support for multi-scattering shading using the precomputed integrals from single scattering models
- accomplishes energy conversation
- the paper derives the GGX approximation for 3 classes of objects (perfect reflectors, generic metals, and  dielectrics)
- presents comparisons against single scattering models in a furnace test
