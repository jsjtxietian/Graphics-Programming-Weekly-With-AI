2025-10-15: [Variable-Rate Texture Compression: Real-Time Rendering with JPEG](https://github.com/elias1518693/jpeg_textures)

- demonstrates a technique to use JPEG textures for real-time integration using OpenGL and CUDA
- uses deferred rendering to identify required JPEG blocks before collaborative workgroup decoding
- presents the pipeline that is defined by geometry, mark, decode, and finally the resolve pass
