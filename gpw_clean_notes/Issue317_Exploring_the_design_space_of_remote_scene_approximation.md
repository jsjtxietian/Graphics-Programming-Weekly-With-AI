2023-12-09: [Exploring the design space of remote scene approximation](https://c0de517e.com/007_impostors.htm)

- the blog presents a walkthrough of the author's R&D process when approaching the issue of generation of a scene approximation
- shows how to analyze the constraints, develop a high-level intuition for the problem, and use this to explore the problem space
- discusses the different solutions' pros & cons and shows how to start prototyping and iterating through the process
