2025-05-15: [Path Tracing Optimizations in Indiana Jones™: Opacity MicroMaps and Compaction of Dynamic BLASs](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/path-tracing-optimizations-in-indiana-jones-opacity-micromaps-and-compaction-of-dynamic-blass/)

- details GPU optimizations that improved path tracing performance in Indiana Jones
- presents how Opacity MicroMaps (OMMs) reduced overhead for alpha tested geometry and which issues they ran into during the integration
- additionally mentions that compaction of Bottom-Level Acceleration Structures (BLASs) halved the memory consumption for vegetation meshes
