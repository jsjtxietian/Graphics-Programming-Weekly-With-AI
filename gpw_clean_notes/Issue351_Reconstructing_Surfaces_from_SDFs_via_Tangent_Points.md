2024-07-23: [Reconstructing Surfaces from SDFs via Tangent Points](http://odedstein.com/projects/reach-for-the-arcs)

- the paper presents a method that converts an SDF into a point cloud
- point cloud is then converted into a mesh surface
- compares the quality of the new algorithm against existing solutions
