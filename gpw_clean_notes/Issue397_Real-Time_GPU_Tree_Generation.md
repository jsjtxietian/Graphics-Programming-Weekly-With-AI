2025-06-24: [Real-Time GPU Tree Generation](https://diglib.eg.org/items/93fc78c0-71fa-4511-8564-a7e5268bf27a)

- the paper presents a work graph-based procedural system for generating and rendering trees entirely on the GPU
- shows how the model used to generate the tree structure
- presents how this is mapped onto the work graph execution logic
- additionally discusses how seasonal effects and wind effects are integrated
