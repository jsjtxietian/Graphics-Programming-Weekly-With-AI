- the slides cover the difficulties of VR and what is required for a good user experience
- presents what hardware features the PS5 GPU supports to improve the results
- shows how raytracing was integrated into the rendering pipeline and an overview of the overall rendering pipeline
- covers how the sky rendering was implemented, introducing the mie approximations used
- additionally presents how multiple weather skys are implemented using multiple sets of lookup textures that are blended
