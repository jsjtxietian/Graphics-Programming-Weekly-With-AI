2021: [[video] (Ab)using RTX for Element Point Location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc5u9EqwHJ8)

- provides an explanation of point queries and why point queries on unstructured data is a lot more complex compared to grid-based data
- the paper presents different methods to offload more work onto the RT cores with increasing complexity
- shows memory and performance results on different hardware and test cases
