2020-10-05: [Scaling Probe-Based Real-Time Dynamic Global Illumination for Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10796)

- the paper presents extensions to the [probe based irradiance-field-with-visibility representation](http://jcgt.org/published/0008/02/01/)
- These extensions include a self-shadow bias, introduction of heuristics to speed transitions, re-use for recursive glossy reflection, probe state machines as well as multiresolution cascaded volumes
