- the blog post discusses how to combine raytraced and shadows from shadow maps
- detect areas where shadow map resolution is too low to represent the edges and trace rays instead
- presents different methods, compares performance and quality
- additionally presents a summary and comparison against the AMD hybrid raytracing shadows technique
