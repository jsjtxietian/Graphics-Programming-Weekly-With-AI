2019-07-22: [Axis-Aligned Bounding Tetrahedra and Octahedra for Ray Tracing Bounding Volume Hierarchies](https://medium.com/@bromanz/axis-aligned-bounding-tetrahedra-and-octahedra-for-ray-tracing-bounding-volume-hierarchies-683751d84bca)

- presents Axis-Aligned-Bounding-Tetrahedron (AABT) and Axis-Aligned-Bounding-Octahedron (AABO) as alternative approaches to  axis-aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)  to build acceleration structures
- displays the data structures in 2D and extends into 3D
- showing results and possible proposals for more research into the topic
