2024: [Efficient Scene Appearance Aggregation for Level-of-Detail Rendering](https://mangosister.github.io/scene_agn_site/)

- the paper presents a framework for volumetric scene prefiltering and level-of-detail rendering
- to improve geometric fit of voxel approximations, it introduces a truncated ellipsoid primitive
- shows how the technique allows accurate LoD rendering closely matching the ground truth at all scales.
