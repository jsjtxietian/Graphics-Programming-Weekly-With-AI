Unknown Date: [Temporally Adaptive Shading Reuse for Real-Time Rendering and Virtual Reality](https://arbook.icg.tugraz.at/schmalstieg/Schmalstieg_396.pdf)

- the paper investigates how shading reuse is perceived when visibility and shading rate is decoupled
- presents that even in dynamic scenes, it's possible to reuse a large amount of shading information
- shows different methods that can be used to predictively shade, compares the results, and present limitations
