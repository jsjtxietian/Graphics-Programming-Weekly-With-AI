2019-09-22: [Selectively Metropolised Monte Carlo light transport simulation](http://benedikt-bitterli.me/smlt/)

- the paper presents a new scheme that allows selectively combining different Monte Carlo rendering algorithms
- allow the use of less computational complex algorithms for more straightforward light transport cases and more sophisticated algorithms for more complicated cases
- enables to reduce the overall amount of noise in the same render time
