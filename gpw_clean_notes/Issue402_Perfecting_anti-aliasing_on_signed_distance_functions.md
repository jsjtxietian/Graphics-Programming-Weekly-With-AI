- explains techniques for implementing anti-aliasing with signed distance functions (SDFs)
- compares linear, smoothstep, and smootherstep transitions for both pixel-wise AA and blur effects
- demonstrates how to use numerical derivatives with fwidth() to maintain consistent AA regardless of perspective
- additionally presents the effect of color space choices
