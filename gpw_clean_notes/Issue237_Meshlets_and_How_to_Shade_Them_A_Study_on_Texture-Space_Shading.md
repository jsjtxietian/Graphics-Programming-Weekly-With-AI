2022-05-26: [Meshlets and How to Shade Them: A Study on Texture-Space Shading](https://arbook.icg.tugraz.at/schmalstieg/Schmalstieg_405.pdf)

- the paper presents the idea of the usage of a meshlet atlas for texture space shading
- the presented technique is based on meshlets and transforms per-meshlet information into texture space where shading for the samples will take place
- shows how to use meshlets as the basis for texture space management to use the available texture space efficently
- additionally compares quality and performance against other methods
