2018-07-01: [Veldrid Support for SPIR-V Shaders](https://mellinoe.github.io/graphics/2018/06/25/veldrid-spirv.html)

- low-level C# graphics library now supports SPIR-V shader for all supported backends
- exposes specialization constants on the API level and emulates them at translation time for backends that don't support them
