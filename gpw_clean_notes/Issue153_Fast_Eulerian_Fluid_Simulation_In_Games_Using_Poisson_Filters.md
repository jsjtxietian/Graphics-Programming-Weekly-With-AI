2020-10-19: [Fast Eulerian Fluid Simulation In Games Using Poisson Filters](https://www.shahinrabbani.ca/torch2pd.html)

- the research presents a 2D fluid simulation in a 3D scene used to generate fire effects
- explains separable Poisson filters that are used to fluid simulations
- the demo video shows the technique interact within the 3D world to respond to wind, collision, and other forces
