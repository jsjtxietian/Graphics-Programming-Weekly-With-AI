Unknown Date: [[video] I made a Compression Algorithm for Heightmap Terrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KkVftV-PTk)

- the video explains a compression technique developed for height field compression
- covering quantization, quadtree, delta encoding, as well as linear regression
- source code as a Godot implementation is provided
