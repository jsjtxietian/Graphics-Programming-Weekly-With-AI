2021: [[video] Tier 2 Variable Rate Shading in Gears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-exWLpgnOJ4&list=PLRs2lXTYCDQ2Dbiwf8VIBmROp41A6SgG_&index=9)

- overview of Variable Rate Shading (VRS), what is supported with Tier 1 and 2
- edge detection run as part of the tone mapping step, generating two shading images (default and conservative)
- VRS shading rate image is also read in compute shaders for reduced shading rate for compute shaders
- presents performance numbers
