2019-02-04: [Approximating water effects using terrain height maps part 1: Reflections](https://blog.uhawkvr.com/rendering/approximate-terrain-reflections/)

- discusses screen space reflection and planar reflections techniques
- presented technique for reflections uses ray-marching against the terrain height map to calculate the reflections
- show that the technique could be extended to trace against signed distances fields to add reflection for other objects too
