2023-10-16: [Locally-Adaptive LOD for Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/ray-tracing-hw-adaptive-lod)

- the paper introduces a level of detail technique for triangular meshes for use with ray tracing workloads
- proposes a data structure for hierarchically representing triangle meshes, allowing localized decisions for the desired mesh resolution per ray
