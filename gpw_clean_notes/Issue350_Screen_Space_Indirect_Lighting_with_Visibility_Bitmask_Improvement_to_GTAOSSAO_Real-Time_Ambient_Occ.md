2024-07-30: [Screen Space Indirect Lighting with Visibility Bitmask: Improvement to GTAO/SSAO Real-Time Ambient Occlusion Algorithm (GLSL Shader Implementation)](https://cybereality.com/screen-space-indirect-lighting-with-visibility-bitmask-improvement-to-gtao-ssao-real-time-ambient-occlusion-algorithm-glsl-shader-implementation)

- the blog post provides an overview of the author's implementation of Screen Space Indirect Lighting with Visibility Bitmask
- presents an overview of the technique, discussing tradeoffs of the implementation
- shows the results in-engine in a test scene and shows the shader implementation in GLSL
