2024-04-17: [Transforming a Non-Differentiable Rasterizer into a Differentiable One with Stochastic Gradient Estimation](https://ggx-research.github.io/publication/2024/04/17/publication-intel-diffrast.html)

- the paper presents a method that allows existing non-differentiable rasterizers to be made differentiable
- explains the underlying technique and how to derive per-pixel stochastic gradient estimation
- shows how to use the concepts to implement a 3D assets optimization system
