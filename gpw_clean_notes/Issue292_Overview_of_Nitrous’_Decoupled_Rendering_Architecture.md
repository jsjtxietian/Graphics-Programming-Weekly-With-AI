2023-06-21: [Overview of Nitrous’ Decoupled Rendering Architecture](http://enginearchitecture.realtimerendering.com/downloads/reac2023_decoupled_shading.pdf)

- the presentation slides explain the improvements done to decoupled shading
- discusses how decoupled shading enables improved visual stability
- presents how the technique has been implemented by using Shadels that reduces the limitations of overshading of previous iterations of the technique
- show how to generate a PrimiteID texture from rasterization as a replacement for position texture maps
- additionally shows how the material system has been designed to enable utilization of the new shading method
