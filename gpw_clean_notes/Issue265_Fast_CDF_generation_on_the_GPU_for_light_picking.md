Unknown Date: [Fast CDF generation on the GPU for light picking](https://blog.traverseresearch.nl/fast-cdf-generation-on-the-gpu-for-light-picking-5c50b97c552b)

- the blog post explains how to build a cumulative distribution function (CDF) to accelerate the sampling of lights in a real-time ray tracer
- explains the high-level concept of a CDF and shows how to implement this on the GPU
- presents how to optimize the implementation to better take advantage of GPU hardware and utilize wave instructions for further optimizations
