2023-06-05: [Stochastic Subsets for Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) Construction](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/bvh-construction.html)

- The paper presents a new approach for constructing Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) by leveraging sampling techniques
- the aim is to create higher quality BVHs to be maintained under real-time dynamic conditions and minimize the need for refitting
- The presented approach involves ordering input primitives using a space-filling curve and building a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for sampling
