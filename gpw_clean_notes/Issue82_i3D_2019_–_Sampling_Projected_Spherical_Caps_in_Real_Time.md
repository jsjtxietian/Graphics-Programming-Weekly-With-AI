2019-04-28: [i3D 2019 – Sampling Projected Spherical Caps in Real Time](http://momentsingraphics.de/?page_id=228)

- presents a new technique for a stochastic sampling of spherical area lights that is suitable for GPU implementations
- able to reduce noise from unoccluded areas significantly
- based on cutting the projected spherical cap into disks and sampling the disks instead
