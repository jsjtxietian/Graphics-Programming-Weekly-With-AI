2018-05-14: [Efficient Rendering of Layered Materials using an Atomic Decomposition with Statistical Operators](https://belcour.github.io/blog/research/2018/05/05/brdf-realtime-layered.html)

- new model for layered materials
- statistical analysis that uses an atomic decomposition of light transport to predict scattering in the layered structure
- per layer statistics are combined into a scattering function as mixture of microfacet models
