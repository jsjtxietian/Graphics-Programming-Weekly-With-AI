Unknown Date: [Hierarchical Light Sampling with Accurate Spherical Gaussian Lighting](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/Hierarchical_Light_Sampling_with_Accurate_Spherical_Gaussian_Lighting.pdf)

- This paper presents an approximation of the importance based on spherical Gaussians (SGs) for light clusters
- Each light cluster is represented as an SG light and analytically approximates the product integral of the SG light and a BRDF
- presents how to use the method to reduce the MC variance for many light scenes
