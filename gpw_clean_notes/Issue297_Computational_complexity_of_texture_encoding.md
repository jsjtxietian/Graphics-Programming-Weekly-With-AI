2023-07-23: [Computational complexity of texture encoding](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2023/07/21/computational-complexity-of-texture-encoding/)

- the article explains how most tecture encoding formats operate in blocks, presenting how this reduces time complexity
- Additional computational complexity of encoding textures depends on the search space of possible endpoint/mode combinations, which can be reduced using heuristics and pruning techniques
