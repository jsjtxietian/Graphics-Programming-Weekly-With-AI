2022-07-09: [GPU-Driven Real-Time Mesh Contour Vectorization](http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/sr20221159)

- the paper presents a new GPU-based method to generate 2D contour strokes from 3D meshes
- proposed solution uses a preprocessing step to analyze the adjacency and geometric information
- discusses the different steps of implementation
- it additionally shows how to further utilize the counter edge lines to support different patterns
- example implementation in Unity is provided
