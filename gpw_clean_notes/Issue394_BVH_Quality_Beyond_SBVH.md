- investigates techniques to improve Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) quality
- challenges common assumptions about binned vs. full-sweep SAH building and demonstrates that bin count significantly impacts performance
- introduces Representative Ray Sets (RRS) for BVH quality assessment and optimization, showing that significant performance improvements ( >50% ) are possible
- opening the discussion that offline builds of optimized static geometry BVHs might be worthwhile to explore
