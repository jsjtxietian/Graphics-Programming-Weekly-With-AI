2024-05-24: [Construction of a Microfacet Specular BSDF: A Geometric Approach](https://zero-radiance.github.io/post/microfacet-specular/)

- the paper provides a walkthrough explanation of the different components that define a BSDF (bidirectional scattering distribution function) that defines the shading behavior of a materials
- covers the underlying theory, explaining the derivation as well as the geometric interpretations
