2021-06-29: [ReSTIR GI: Path Resampling for Real-Time Path Tracing](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2021-06_ReSTIR-GI%3A-Path)

- paper presents a new path sampling algorithm for indirect lighting
- based on the screen-space Spatio-temporal resampling principles of ReSTIR (Spatiotemporal reservoir resampling for real-time ray tracing with dynamic direct lighting.)
- enables important paths to share contributions time, space
