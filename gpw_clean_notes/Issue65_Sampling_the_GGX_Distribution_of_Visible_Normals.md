0007-04-01: [Sampling the GGX Distribution of Visible Normals](http://www.jcgt.org/published/0007/04/01/)

- explains a new model for sampling visible normals of the GGX distribution
- summarizes the properties of GGX and how sampling a 2D projection of the truncated ellipsoid is equivalent to sampling the visible normals of the GGX distribution
- the method is more precise and quicker than previous methods
- provides a GLSL implementation
