2018: [Stratified Sampling of Projected Spherical Caps](http://www.iliyan.com/publications/ProjectedSphericalCaps)

- a technique to improve importance sampling for spherical light sources by projecting the visible spherical cap onto a 2D plane, and taking uniform samples within this plane
- yields noise-free direct illumination for constant illumination with no occluders
