2023-06-24: [Real-Time Ray Tracing of Micro-Poly Geometry with Hierarchical Level of Detail](https://momentsingraphics.de/HPG2023.html)

- the paper introduces a method that enables micro-poly geometry for raytracing workloads
- geometry is preprocessed, clusters formed and simplified into a compressed hierarchical level of detail representation
- presents how using clusters enables fast BVH building
- in the appendix discusses in detail how to select clusters to be guaranteed crack-free between different clusters
