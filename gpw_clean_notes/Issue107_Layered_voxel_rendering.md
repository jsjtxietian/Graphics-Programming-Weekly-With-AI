2019-11-14: [Layered voxel rendering](https://jobtalle.com/layered_voxel_rendering.html)

- the article proposes a solution for voxel rendering
- voxel scene is pre-calculated into multiple vertical slices
- each slice is represented by an image and stores all voxel in the slice
- additionally contains a logic summary on how to procedurally generate a voxel-based island
