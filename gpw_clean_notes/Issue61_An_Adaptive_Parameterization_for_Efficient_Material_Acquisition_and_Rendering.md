2018-11-03: [An Adaptive Parameterization for Efficient Material Acquisition and Rendering](http://rgl.epfl.ch/publications/Dupuy2018Adaptive)

- paper on BRDF measurement which proposes a new parameterization that adapts to the behavior of the material
- able to significantly reduce the number of samples required
- published a new large database of measured BRDFs that have been captured using this technique
