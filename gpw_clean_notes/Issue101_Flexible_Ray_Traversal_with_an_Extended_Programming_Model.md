2019-10-07: [Flexible Ray Traversal with an Extended Programming Model](http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/wjlee/traversalshader.html)

- the paper proposes the addition of a Traversal Shader stage to the DXR model
- this shader stage allows the programmable selection of acceleration structures
- presented use cases are stochastic LOD selection, choice of LOD levels based on ray type and improved multi-level instancing performance
