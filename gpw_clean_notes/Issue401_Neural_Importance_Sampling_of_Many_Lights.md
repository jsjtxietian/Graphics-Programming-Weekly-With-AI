2025-07-28: [Neural Importance Sampling of Many Lights](https://pedrovfigueiredo.github.io/projects/manylights/SIGGRAPH_2025_Importance_Sampling/index.html)

- SIGGRAPH 2025 paper presenting a neural approach for estimating spatially varying light selection distributions in many-light scenarios
- uses a neural network trained to predict light selection distributions based on local information
- integrates with light hierarchy techniques and introduces residual learning to accelerate convergence during training
