2021-10-01: [Fast temporal reprojection without motion vectors](https://jcgt.org/published/0010/03/02/)

- the paper proposes a new technique to enable the temporal reuse of samples in scenarios where motion vectors are not enough / available
- core algorithm of the paper is patch-based correspondence detection within a hierarchical
