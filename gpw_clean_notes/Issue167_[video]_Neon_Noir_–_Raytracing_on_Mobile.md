2021: [[video] Neon Noir – Raytracing on Mobile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjTn6LAZjNc&feature=youtu.be)

- talk provides an overview of the Crytek rendering pipeline
- how a Micro-G buffer is used to reduce the bandwidth required
- encoding, reconstruction errors, and performance comparison
- how the raytracing is implemented using compute shaders
- BVH data structures, using interlaced ray tracing for ray count reduction
- data optimizations for BVH objects
