2021-02-05: [Fast Radius Search Exploiting Ray Tracing Frameworks](http://www.jcgt.org/published/0010/01/02/)

- the paper presents a method that maps spacial search in a fixed radius into a ray tracing paradigm
- this allows the ways to take advantage of ray tracing hardware to speed up the operations
- presents an application for GI with progressive photon mapping and point-cloud registration of partial surface scans
