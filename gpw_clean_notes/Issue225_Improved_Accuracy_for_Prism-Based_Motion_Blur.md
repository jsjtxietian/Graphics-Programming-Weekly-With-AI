2022-03-07: [Improved Accuracy for Prism-Based Motion Blur](https://jcgt.org/published/0011/01/05/)

- the paper presents a method for improving the quality of motion blur on dynamic triangulated objects
- it approximates the nonlinear depth, normal, and UV functions
- the adaptive solution is based on prism volume and will adapt based on the motion and features
