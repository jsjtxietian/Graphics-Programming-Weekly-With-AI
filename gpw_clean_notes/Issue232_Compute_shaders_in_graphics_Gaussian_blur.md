2022-04-22: [Compute shaders in graphics: Gaussian blur](https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/graphics/2022/04/21/compute-blur.html)

- the article presents the authors' first experience with writing a compute shader to implement a Gaussian blur
- presents the different stages of the experiment, presenting performance numbers for different work sizes and execution patterns
- this shows how writing pixel shaders can outperform unoptimized compute shaders by a large margin
