Unknown Date: [Antithetic Sampling for Monte Carlo Differentiable Rendering](https://shuangz.com/projects/antithetic-sg21/)

- the paper presents antithetic variance reduction technique used to estimate the interior integrals
- shows the usage of the technique for Monte Carlo differentiable rendering of glossy and BSDFs
- antithetic sampling is the use of negatively correlated samples instead of independent samples
