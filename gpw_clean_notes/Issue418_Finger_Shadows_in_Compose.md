- demonstrates using Android's RuntimeShader API to simulate soft shadows projected by the user's finger onto the UI
- models the finger as a 3D capsule and computes soft shadow visibility by calculating the spherical caps' intersection
- provides the complete AGSL shader implementation, including optimized trigonometric functions
