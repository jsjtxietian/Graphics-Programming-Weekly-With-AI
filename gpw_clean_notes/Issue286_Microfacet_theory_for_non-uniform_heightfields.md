2023-05-04: [Microfacet theory for non-uniform heightfields](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/rtr/microfacet-theory-non-uniform-heightfields/)

- the paper proposes a new method for the combination of rough surface NDFs
- The presented techniques aim to accurately simulate multiple scattering from heightfields with height-dependent roughness and material properties
- the solution is based on a layered-Smith microfacet model
