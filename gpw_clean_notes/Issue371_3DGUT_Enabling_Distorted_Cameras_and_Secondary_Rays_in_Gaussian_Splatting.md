2024-12-18: [3DGUT: Enabling Distorted Cameras and Secondary Rays in Gaussian Splatting](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/3DGUT/)

- the paper presents a reformulation of Gaussian Splatting to allow nonlinear camera projections
- explains the concepts of Unscented Transform and how splatting can be reformulated using the method
- additionally presents how the method allows the same representation to be used with raytracing implementations
