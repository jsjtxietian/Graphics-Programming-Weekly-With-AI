2018-07-22: [A High-Performance Software Graphics Pipeline Architecture for the GPU](http://www.markussteinberger.net/publications.php)

- paper discussing the software implementation of the rasterization pipeline using compute shaders
- using a dynamic approach that adjusts to the workload dynamically
- comparison within environments taken from games to evaluate the pipeline overhead
- showcase of what kind of effects are possible with a software approach
- custom primitive rendering
- programmable blending
- adaptive supersampling
- in-depth performance comparison against hardware and other software approaches
