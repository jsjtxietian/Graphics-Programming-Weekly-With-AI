- the Vulkan tutorial shows how to use the Vulkan VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur extension (exposed by Nvidia)
- shows how to extend a static ray tracer implementation with the necessary information to support motion(blur)
- contains API extensions for time-dependent tracing, motion support in acceleration structures, and support for changing vertex positions
