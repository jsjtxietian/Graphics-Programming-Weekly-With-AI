2025-10-30: [Jackknife Transmittance and MIS Weight Estimation](https://momentsingraphics.de/SiggraphAsia2025.html)

- SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 paper introducing a biased transmittance estimator with significantly reduced bias compared to naive ray marching
- applies the UMVU estimator based on nearly normally distributed optical depth estimates from stratified jittered sampling
- extends the theory to estimate MIS weights and proposes two new integrators combining MIS with improved transmittance estimation
