- the paper presents a technique to discover a potentially visible set (PVS) of triangles visible from a region of space
- this technique uses ray shooting guided by Adaptive Border Sampling and  Reverse Sampling
- provides an overview of how the method was implemented using Vulkan hardware Raytracing
