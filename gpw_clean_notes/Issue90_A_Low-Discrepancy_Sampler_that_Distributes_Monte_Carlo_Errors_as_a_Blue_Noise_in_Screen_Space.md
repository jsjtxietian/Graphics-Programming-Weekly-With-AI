2019-06-21: [A Low-Discrepancy Sampler that Distributes Monte Carlo Errors as a Blue Noise in Screen Space](https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/762-2/)

- new path tracing sampler techniques
- distributed per-pixel samples so that errors are distributed as blue noise in screen space
- provides C++ source code
- comparison against other methods at various sample counts
