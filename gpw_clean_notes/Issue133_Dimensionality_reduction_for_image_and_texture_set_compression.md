2020-05-25: [Dimensionality reduction for image and texture set compression](https://bartwronski.com/2020/05/21/dimensionality-reduction-for-image-and-texture-set-compression/)

- detailed post presents the idea of “decorrelating” color channels to maximize information in texture channels and eliminate redundancy allowing data to be stored in fewer color channels
- introduction into Singular Value Decomposition SVD and how it can be used for channel decorrelation
- showing quality comparisons for a PBR texture set and discusses possible problems
