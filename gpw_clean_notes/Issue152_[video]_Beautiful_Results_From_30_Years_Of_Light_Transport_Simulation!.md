Unknown Date: [[video] Beautiful Results From 30 Years Of Light Transport Simulation!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Popg7ej4AUU&feature=youtu.be)

- the video shows the history of light transport techniques and presents how they perform in complex test cases
- leading up to "Specular Manifold Sampling for Rendering High-Frequency Caustics and Glints" and how it makes aims to make state of the art a more accessible
