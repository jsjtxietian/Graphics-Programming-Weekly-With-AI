- the longer the CPU/GPU can idle, the less power is needed
- optimizing a CPU bound game might cause more frames to be rendered (hitting 60 fps instead of 30). causing less GPU idle time and increasing power consumption
- kernel heuristics might trigger higher frequency mode which increases battery usage significantly
