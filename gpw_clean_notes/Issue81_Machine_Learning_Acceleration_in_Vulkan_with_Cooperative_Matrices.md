2019-04-20: [Machine Learning Acceleration in Vulkan with Cooperative Matrices](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/machine-learning-acceleration-vulkan-cooperative-matrices/)

- shows the Cooperative Matrix extension for Vulkan
- the extension enables matrix multiplications to be computed across a subgroup
- enables better shader optimizations and allows the use of tensor cores on Turing GPUs
