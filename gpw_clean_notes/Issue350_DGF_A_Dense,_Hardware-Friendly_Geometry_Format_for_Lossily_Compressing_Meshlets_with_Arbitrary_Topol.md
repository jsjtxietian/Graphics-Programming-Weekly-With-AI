2024-07-17: [DGF: A Dense, Hardware-Friendly Geometry Format for Lossily Compressing Meshlets with Arbitrary Topologies](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/DGF.pdf)

- the paper presents a block-compressed geometry format
- explains the data packing applied, what can be encoded, and how to compress it
- presents memory comparisons against existing solutions
- additionally shows how hardware support with ray-tracing BVH builds might reduce memory consumption
