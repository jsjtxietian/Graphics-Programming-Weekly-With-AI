2025-07-10: [HyAB k-means for color quantization](https://30fps.net/pages/hyab-kmeans/)

- presents a new approach to color quantization using the HyAB distance formula in CIELAB color space
- compares results against exisitngs methods
- demonstrates how a hybrid distance metric (absolute difference in lightness, Euclidean in chromaticity) improves color fidelity in quantized images
