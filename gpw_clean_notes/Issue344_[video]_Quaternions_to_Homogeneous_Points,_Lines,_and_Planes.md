2024: [[video] Quaternions to Homogeneous Points, Lines, and Planes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSe7eg8Dj98)

- the second path of the math tutorial series from GDC 2024 extends the dual quaternion knowledge (see last week 338 for prerequisite)
- starts by developing an intuition for plane representation (normal + distance), difference between positions and directions, and behavior under reflections
- additionally explains the understanding of homogenous concepts
