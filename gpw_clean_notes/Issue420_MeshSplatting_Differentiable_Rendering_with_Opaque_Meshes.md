2025-12-11: [MeshSplatting: Differentiable Rendering with Opaque Meshes](https://meshsplatting.github.io/)

- presents a mesh-based reconstruction approach that jointly optimizes geometry and appearance through differentiable rendering
- uses restricted Delaunay triangulation to enforce connectivity and creates smooth surfaces with opaque triangles
