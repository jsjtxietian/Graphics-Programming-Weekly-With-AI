2021-08-16: [SIGGRAPH 2021 Talk- Unbiased Emission and Scattering Importance Sampling for Heterogeneous Volumes](https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2021/08/unbiased-emission-and-scattering-volumes.html)

- the paper presents a new distance sampling method
- presents an extension for the null-collision integral formulation that improves efficiency for low-order heterogeneous (such as fog)
- additionally presents an approach using a spatial guiding data structure
