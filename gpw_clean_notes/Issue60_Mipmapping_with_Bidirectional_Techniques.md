2018-10-28: [Mipmapping with Bidirectional Techniques](https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2018/10/bidirectional-mipmap.html)

- brief overview about what mips are and how to calculate mip selection in a rasterizer
- explains ray differentials, a technique that can be used for mip selecttion on primary rays
- discussion of problems with ray differentials on other ray types, possible solutions and look at what other production renderers use
- solution using a distance to camera metric and presenting the results by comparing against other techniques
