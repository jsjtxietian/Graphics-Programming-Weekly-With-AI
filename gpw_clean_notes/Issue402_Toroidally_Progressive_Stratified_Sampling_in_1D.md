2025-08-04: [Toroidally Progressive Stratified Sampling in 1D](https://blog.demofox.org/2025/08/03/toroidally-progressive-stratified-sampling-in-1d/)

- introduces a technique that combines stratified sampling with golden ratio sequence ordering
- creates sampling patterns that maintain good quality at any sample count and across sequence boundaries
- compares error convergence with standard white noise
