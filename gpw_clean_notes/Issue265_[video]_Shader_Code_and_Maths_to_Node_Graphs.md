2022: [[video] Shader Code and Maths to Node Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0NxObQqzek)

- the presentation focuses on how to approach the implementation of abstract code/math expressions to make it easier to work with
- presents the importance of breaking down more complex expressions into sub-expression and visualizing individual components
- shows the approaches by implementing randomized water puddle placement, a Gerstner Waves simulation, as well as using flow maps to displace water around obstacles
