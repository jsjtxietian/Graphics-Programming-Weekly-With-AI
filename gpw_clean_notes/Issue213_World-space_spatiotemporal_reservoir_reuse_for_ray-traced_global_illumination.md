2021-12-10: [World-space spatiotemporal reservoir reuse for ray-traced global illumination](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/SA2021_WorldSpace_ReSTIR.pdf)

- the paper presents a technique that performs reservoir-based spatiotemporal importance resampling in world space
- caches in the cells of a hash grid built on the GPU along the path vertices
