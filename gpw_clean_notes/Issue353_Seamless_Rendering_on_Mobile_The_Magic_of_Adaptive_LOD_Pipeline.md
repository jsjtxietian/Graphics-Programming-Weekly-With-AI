2024-08-16: [Seamless Rendering on Mobile: The Magic of Adaptive LOD Pipeline](https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2024/content/Cao-NanoMesh/AdavanceRealtimeRendering_NanoMesh0810.pdf)

- the presentation discusses how to use cluster-based mesh representations to allow transitions between model levels
- shows how to calculate the cluster representations calculate cluster error metrics to allow LOD selection
- additionally, it discusses how to integrate support for skinned meshes
- provides performance numbers for the different stages of the pipeline
