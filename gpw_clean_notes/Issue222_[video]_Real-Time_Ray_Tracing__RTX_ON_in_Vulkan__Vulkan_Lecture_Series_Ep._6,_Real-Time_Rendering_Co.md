- Video lecture series of the real-time rendering course at TU Wien
- this part covers how to use hardware-accelerated ray tracing from Vulkan
- covers everything required to render a static scene, accelerations, ray traversal, shader bindings as well as processing hits
- additionally presents ray queries to allow ray tracing from any shader stage and discusses the limitations
