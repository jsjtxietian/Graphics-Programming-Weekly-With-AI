2021-01-29: [Neural Geometric Level of Detail Real-time Rendering with Implicit 3D Surfaces](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/nglod/)

- the paper presents a deep neural network to generate signed distance functions using a fixed network and sparse oct-tree
- the network also generates the level of detail representations
- shows real-time reconstruction and rendering with ray tracing
