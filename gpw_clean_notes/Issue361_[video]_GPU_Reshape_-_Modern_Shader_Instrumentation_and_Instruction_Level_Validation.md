Unknown Date: [[video] GPU Reshape - Modern Shader Instrumentation and Instruction Level Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivwD6n-XXQk)

- the talk provides an overview of instrumentation-based GPU Validation system
- explains what kind of validation is currently supported, how operations are written in IL agnostic fashion
- additionally presents how to develop your own features for the system
- and presents a view into abilities that instrumentation could enable beyond validation (debugging, data visualization, profiling)
