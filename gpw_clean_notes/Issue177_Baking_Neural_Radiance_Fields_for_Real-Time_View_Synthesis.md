2021-03-31: [Baking Neural Radiance Fields for Real-Time View Synthesis](https://phog.github.io/snerg/index.html)

- the paper presents a novel sparse Neural Radiance Grid representation
- this representation allows Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to be baked so that rendering can be archived in realtime
