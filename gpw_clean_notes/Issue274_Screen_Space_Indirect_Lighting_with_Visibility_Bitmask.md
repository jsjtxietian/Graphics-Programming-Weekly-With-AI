2023-01-30: [Screen Space Indirect Lighting with Visibility Bitmask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11376)

- the paper proposes an expansion of Horizon-based indirect illumination by using visibility bitmasks instead of horizon angles
- stores (occluded / un-occluded) of N sectors uniformly distributed around the hemisphere slice instead
- meant to improve results for thin surfaces
