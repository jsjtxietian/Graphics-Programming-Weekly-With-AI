2024-12-03: [GFFE: G-buffer Free Frame Extrapolation for Low-latency Real-time Rendering](https://poiw.github.io/publication/gffe)

- the paper presents an image upscaler that is designed to extrapolate from color, depth, and motion vector inputs to a variable number of frames
- discusses the implementation of the motion estimation, background collection, adaptive rendering windows, and shading correction network modules
- presents performance and quality against existing techniques
