2021: [[video] How to calculate Normal Vectors in Shader Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arCHjoQHgEU&feature=youtu.be)

- shows why normals need to be recalculated if a mesh shape is changed in a vertex shader
- presents how to re-calculate the normals by applying the same offsets to approximate neighbors and recalculating the normal from this
- simplified video version of [How to Calculate Shader Graph Normals](https://gamedevbill.com/shader-graph-normal-calculation/)
