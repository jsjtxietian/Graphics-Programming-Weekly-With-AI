2021: [Tiled Reservoir Sampling for Many-Light Rendering](https://yusuketokuyoshi.com/)

- the paper introduces a combination of tile-based stochastic light culling and reservoir sampling
- this reduces the variance for lights close to surfaces such as common in Virtual Point Lights (VPLs) based indirect illumination systems
