2021-10-15: [Recovering Real-World Reflectance Properties and Shading From HDR Imagery](https://research.fb.com/publications/recovering-real-world-reflectance-properties-and-shading-from-hdr-imagery/)

- the paper presents how using HDR and 3D scan data, it's possible to reconstruct the material BRDF parameters
- shows how to estimate the diffuse lighting, surface albedo and use this information to treat it as an optimization problem to match the original image
