2025-08-25: [Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling](https://jcgt.org/published/0014/02/01/)

- trained neural cache storing visibility between lights and 3D positions for direct illumination
- integrates MLP with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding
- feeds light visibility data to weighted reservoir sampling
