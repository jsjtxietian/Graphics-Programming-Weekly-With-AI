2020-02-24: [Sampling Analytic Participating Media](https://zero-radiance.github.io/post/analytic-media/)

- the in-depth article presents the physical models and approximations of participating media (such as fog, water)
- presents constant, linear and exponential fog implementations
- extends these solutions to express atmospheres and provides approximations for numerical approaches
