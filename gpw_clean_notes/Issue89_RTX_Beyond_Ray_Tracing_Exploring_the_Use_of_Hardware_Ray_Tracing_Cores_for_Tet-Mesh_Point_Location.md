2019-06-17: [RTX Beyond Ray Tracing: Exploring the Use of Hardware Ray Tracing Cores for Tet-Mesh Point Location](https://hgpu.org/?p=18941)

- the paper investigates using the raytracing hardware support added in Turing GPUs to accelerate other tasks
- uses the hardware to detect in which tetrahedral mesh a point is located
- can achieve better performance than pure CUDA implementation
