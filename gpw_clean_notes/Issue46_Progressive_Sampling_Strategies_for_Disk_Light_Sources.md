2018-07-10: [Progressive Sampling Strategies for Disk Light Sources](https://graphics.pixar.com/library/DiskLightSampling/)

- comparison of combinations of six different sampling strategies for disk area light sources and 9 sample sequences
- testing is done for wholly and partially illuminated regions
- the best result could be achieved with the polar4 strategy introduced in this paper with well-stratified samples
