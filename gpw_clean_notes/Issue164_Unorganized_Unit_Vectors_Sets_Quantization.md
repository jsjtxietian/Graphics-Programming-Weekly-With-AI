2020-12-31: [Unorganized Unit Vectors Sets Quantization](http://jcgt.org/published/0009/04/02/)

- the paper presents a new technique of on-the-fly quantization for unorganized sets of unit vectors
- approach detects groups of windows that are then uniformly mapped onto the whole sphere surface before unit vector quantization is applied
- the presented technique can archive better results than octahedral quantization with only 16 bits
