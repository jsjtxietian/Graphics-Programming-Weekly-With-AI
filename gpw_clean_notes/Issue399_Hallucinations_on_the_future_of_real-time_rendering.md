2025-07-17: [Hallucinations on the future of real-time rendering](https://www.c0de517e.com/023_hpg/hpg2025_keynote_apesce.pdf)

- presents the argument that rendering industry is shifting from technology-driven growth to content delivery and user-generated content as primary revenue drivers
- discusses the role of machine learning in rendering, noting its effectiveness in post-processing but limited impact on core algorithms due to existing analytical solutions
- predicts future trends toward "more real-time, less baking" approaches and advances in dynamic data structures for optimal signal representation
