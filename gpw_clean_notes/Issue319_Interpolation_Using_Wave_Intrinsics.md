2023-12-29: [Interpolation Using Wave Intrinsics](https://github.com/AlexSabourinDev/cranberry_blog/blob/master/WaveActiveLerp.md)

- the article presents a shader function that uses wave intrinsic to calculate interpolation of the result of lane-dependent calculations across lanes
- shows step-by-step how the shader is structured
- additionally presents how to take advantage of SPIR-V inline to further improve the generated code
