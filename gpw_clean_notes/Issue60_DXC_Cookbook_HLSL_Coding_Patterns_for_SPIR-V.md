2018-10-27: [DXC Cookbook: HLSL Coding Patterns for SPIR-V](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/master/docs/SPIRV-Cookbook.rst)

- SPIR-V shaders can only access global resources
- HLSL is very flexible with resource usage
- this post shows what usage pattern DXC is able to transform into legal SPIR-V and what patterns cannot be expressed in SPIR-V
