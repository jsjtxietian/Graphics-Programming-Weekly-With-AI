2025-03-06: [Compression of Spectral Images using Spectral JPEG XL](https://jcgt.org/published/0014/01/04)

- This paper introduces an innovative method for compressing spectral images using existing JPEG XL encoders
- It demonstrates how cosine transforms in the wavelength domain, significantly compressing the dynamic range
- The authors present comprehensive compression results with quality comparisons across different parameters
- They also outline future improvements currently constrained by limitations in the reference JPEG XL implementation
