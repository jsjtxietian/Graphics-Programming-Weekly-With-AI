2023-10-09: [SimLOD: Simultaneous LOD Generation and Rendering](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2023/SCHUETZ-2023-SIMLOD/SCHUETZ-2023-SIMLOD-paper.pdf)

- the paper presents a method to incrementally construct a LOD structure for point clouds directly on the GPU and render points as they are still being loaded
- shows how the tree is built, the interaction between CPU and GPU, as well as a look at the performance
