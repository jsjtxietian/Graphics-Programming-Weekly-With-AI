2019-02-10: [Unity GPU culling experiments Part2 – optimizations](https://www.mpc-rnd.com/unity-gpu-culling-experiments-part2-optimizations/)

- presents how to optimize the compaction pass in a GPU culling pipeline
- reduce memory bandwidth usage by taking advantage of shared memory and compression of data that needs to be processed
- wrap level and shuffle instructions allow further optimizations
