2025-01-16: [Dynamic Rendering local read](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/tree/main/samples/extensions/dynamic_rendering_local_read)

- The Vulkan example presents how to use the VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read and VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering extensions to replace the need for render passes.
- Explains how dynamic rendering compares to Vulkan 1.0.
- Shows how local reads can be used to implement a deferred renderer with a composition pass.
