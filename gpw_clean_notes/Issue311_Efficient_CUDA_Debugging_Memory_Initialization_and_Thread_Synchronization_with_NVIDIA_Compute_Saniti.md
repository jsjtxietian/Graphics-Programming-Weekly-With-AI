2023-10-30: [Efficient CUDA Debugging: Memory Initialization and Thread Synchronization with NVIDIA Compute Sanitizer](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/efficient-cuda-debugging-memory-initialization-and-thread-synchronization-with-nvidia-compute-sanitizer/)

- the article presents the types of checks available by the NVIDIA Compute Sanitizer
- shows how to use sanitizers to detect  memory access errors,  uninitialized device global memory access, thread synchronization hazard detection, and more
- each example is provided with source code to the issue and how the sanitizer helps to detect it
