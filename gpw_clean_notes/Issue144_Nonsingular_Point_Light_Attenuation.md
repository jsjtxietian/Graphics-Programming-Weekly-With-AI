2020: [Nonsingular Point Light Attenuation](http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/pointlightattenuation/?s=09)

- the Siggraph 2020 talk presents the derivation of a point light attenuation that eliminates the singularity as the distance approaches 0
- achieves this by treating point lights as simplified spherical lights
- provides comparisons against other solutions
