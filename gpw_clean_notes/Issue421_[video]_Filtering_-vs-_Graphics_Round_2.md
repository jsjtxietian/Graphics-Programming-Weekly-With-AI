2025: [[video] Filtering -vs- Graphics Round 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8boeQyIEk9Q)

- continues the series with practical solutions and sample patterns for real-time renderers
- shows shader-level techniques (sample distributions, MSAA-aware approaches) and links to Shadertoy experiments for direct testing
- covers trade-offs between artifact reduction and performance, with suggestions that are implementable in real-time
