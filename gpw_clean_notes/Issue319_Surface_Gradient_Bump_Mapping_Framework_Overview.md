2023-12-25: [Surface Gradient Bump Mapping Framework Overview](https://www.jeremyong.com/graphics/2023/12/16/surface-gradient-bump-mapping)

- the paper presents a retelling of the Surface Gradient Bump Mapping Framework paper from the author's perspective
- shows what normal maps are, how they encode information, and what the difference between object and tangent space is
- discusses issues with blending normals from different sources and how the alternative representation can achieve better-blending results
