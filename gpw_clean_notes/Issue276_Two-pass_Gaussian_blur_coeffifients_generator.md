2023-02-27: [Two-pass Gaussian blur coeffifients generator](https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/graphics/2023/02/24/blur-coefficients-generator.html)

- the article provides a calculator that generates offsets and weights for a separable Gaussian blur filter
- allows the specification of a couple of settings (radius, sigma, filtering mode, ...) and generates GLSL code
- explains the underlying logic and shows how to implement the filter in GLSL
