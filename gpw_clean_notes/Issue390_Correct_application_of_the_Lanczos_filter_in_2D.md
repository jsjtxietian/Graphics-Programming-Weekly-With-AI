2025-05-02: [Correct application of the Lanczos filter in 2D](https://github.com/pixelflinger/lanczos-2d)

- comprehensive technical resource clarifying common misconceptions about 2D Lanczos filtering
- proves that the correct 2D application of Lanczos is separable and not a radial basis function
- addresses practical implementation issues like "deringing"
- particularly useful for temporal anti-aliasing and upscaling applications like those in FSR and SGSR
