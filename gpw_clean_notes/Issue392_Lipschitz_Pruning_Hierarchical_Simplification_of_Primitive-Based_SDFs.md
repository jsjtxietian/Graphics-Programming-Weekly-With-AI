2025-05-14: [Lipschitz Pruning: Hierarchical Simplification of Primitive-Based SDFs](https://wbrbr.org/publications/LipschitzPruning/)

- introduces an efficient method for simplifying tree-based analytical Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)
- leverages the Lipschitz property to create simplified equivalents for specific regions of space
- proposes a new technique for sphere tracing of complex SDFs composed of thousands of animated primitives
- the included video visualizes the technique and shows results on various test cases
