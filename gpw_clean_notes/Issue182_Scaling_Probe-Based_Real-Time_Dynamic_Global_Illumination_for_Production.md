0010-02-01: [Scaling Probe-Based Real-Time Dynamic Global Illumination for Production](http://jcgt.org/published/0010/02/01/)

- the paper presents extensions and improvements to the probe-based irradiance-field-with-visibility representation technique
- presents a multiresolution cascaded volumes representation to support large worlds
- improved probe pruning, faster convergence through perception-based irradiance encoding
- additionally presents how to use irradiance probes to shade glossy reflection rays
