- Talk discusses how the performance of the ray-traced direct illumination was greatly improved
- presents an overview of what ReSTIR importance sampling algorithm
- shows to the memory coherence and bandwidth was reduced through pre-randomization of input lists
- additionally discusses how the number of rays could be reduced by decoupling shading, reuse, and visibility
