2021-07-21: [Software VRS with Visibility Buffer Rendering](http://filmicworlds.com/blog/software-vrs-with-visibility-buffer-rendering/)

- the article discusses how Visibility Buffer can be combined with Variable Rate Shading (VRS) Techniques
- shows how careful selection of sample positions can archive convergence towards the reference non-VRS image
- presents the performance of VRS usage for forward, deferred, and visibility approaches. Comparing different pixel densities
- additionally discusses techniques how the sparse g-buffers might be integrated into other rendering passes
