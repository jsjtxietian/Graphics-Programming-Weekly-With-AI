2025: [[video] niagara: Cooking geometry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d04h0sZPwFU)

- live stream focused on making scene loading faster by caching optimized geometry on disk and adding compression
- walks through implementing a basic scene cache, switching to memory-mapped loading, adding compression, and profiling cold/hot runs and page-fault behaviour
- practical andf focused session with profiling runs, implementation details and trade-offs for robust cache/IO design
