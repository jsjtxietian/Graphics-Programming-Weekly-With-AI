2018-11-04: [SPIR-V Compression: SMOL vs MARK](https://aras-p.info/blog/2018/10/31/SPIR-V-Compression-SMOL-vs-MARK/)

- comparison of  two libraries to compress SPIR-V shaders SMOL-V MARK-V
- compares for compression ration, decompression speed, and library size
- MARK-V achieve great compression results, but the library has a large memory footprint and is slow at decompressing the data
