2018-12-03: [A radiative transfer framework for non-exponential media](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/nec/)

- development of a new rendering framework for transmittance for participating media that enables non-exponential media types to be represented
- archived by splitting transmittance into 4 transport functions
- discussion of how to express this new model so that it is intuitive to use and still creates physically correct results
