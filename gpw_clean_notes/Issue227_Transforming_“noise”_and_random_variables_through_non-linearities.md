2022-03-21: [Transforming “noise” and random variables through non-linearities](https://bartwronski.com/2022/03/16/transforming-noise-and-random-variables-through-non-linearities/)

- the article recaps the effects of linear transformations of random variables
- describes three different methods of estimating the effects of nonlinearities on mean and variance/standard deviation
- shows practically how color spaces can affect the behavior of operations such as blurs
