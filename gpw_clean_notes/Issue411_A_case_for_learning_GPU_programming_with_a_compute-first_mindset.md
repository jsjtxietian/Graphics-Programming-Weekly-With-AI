2025-10-06: [A case for learning GPU programming with a compute-first mindset](https://themaister.net/blog/2025/10/05/a-case-for-learning-gpu-programming-with-a-compute-first-mindset/)

- proposes teaching GPU programming through compute shaders before graphics pipelines
- demonstrates starting from simple compute shaders in Vulkan, and using RenderDoc debugging as an essential teaching tool
- presents how to develop from this to understand the execution model, binding model, and how to integrate shader toy examples
- additionally presents next learning steps
