2024: [Anisotropic Specular Image-Based Lighting Based on BRDF Major Axis Sampling](https://xavierchermain.github.io/publications/aniso-ibl)

- the paper proposes an anisotropic specular image-based lighting method that can serve as a drop-in replacement for bent normal techniques
- derives an analytic formula to determine the two closest and two farthest points from the reflected direction on an approximation of the BRDF confidence region boundary
- compares the method against bent normal technique and ground truth using the GGX specular BRDF
