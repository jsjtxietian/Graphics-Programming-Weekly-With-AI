2025-06-24: [No More Shading Languages: Compiling C++ to Vulkan Shaders](https://diglib.eg.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/e3553000-9d53-4d13-a5b0-29dc16a116de/content)

- the paper presents the implementation of a C++ to SPIR-V compiler
- discusses limitations of language constructs, how contracts are mapped onto SPIR-V
- shows how raytracing callable shaders can be used to implement function-calling
