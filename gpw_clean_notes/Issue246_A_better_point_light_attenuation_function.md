2022-07-30: [A better point light attenuation function](https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/graphics/2022/07/30/point-light-attenuation.html)

- the article presents a derivation of a light attenuation function to separately control the maximum intensity and radius
- function is designed to reach zero influence to be used with clustered shading
