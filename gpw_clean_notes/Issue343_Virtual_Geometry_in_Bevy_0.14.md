2024-06-09: [Virtual Geometry in Bevy 0.14](https://jms55.github.io/posts/2024-06-09-virtual-geometry-bevy-0-14/)

- the blog post provides a detailed discussion of implementing meshlet-based virtual geometry rendering into Bevvy
- discusses how meshlet LODs are calculated, how meshlet culling has been implemented, and how they are rendered without mesh shader support
- presents findings from different approaches and discusses the pros/cons of the various approaches
- Additionally, it shows the integration work for supporting systems (depth pyramid generation, material shading, etc.).
