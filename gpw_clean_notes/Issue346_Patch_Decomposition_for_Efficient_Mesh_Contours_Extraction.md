2024-06-25: [Patch Decomposition for Efficient Mesh Contours Extraction](https://hal.science/hal-04620165)

- the paper presents a method for the efficient extraction of mesh contours
- it proposes a simple, flat data structure that is GPU-friendly and uses  patches bounded by normal cones and sphere
- discusses how to generate these patches and improve bounding sphere calculations
- presents a performance comparison against CPU techniques
