- the blog post introduces a prototyping programming platform for shader development
- exposes a way to use a visual node graph editor and HLSL shader nodes for the development of shader techniques
- allows the export of the developed solution into D3D12 code (more targets will be supported later)
- the video tutorial presents how to use the system and the debug tools available to implement a box blur technique
