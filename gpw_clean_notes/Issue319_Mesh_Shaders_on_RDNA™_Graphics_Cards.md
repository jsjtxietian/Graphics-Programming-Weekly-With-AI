2023-12-19: [Mesh Shaders on RDNA™ Graphics Cards](https://gpuopen.com/learn/mesh-shaders-on-rdna-graphics-cards/)

- the blog post is the beginning of a series covering mesh shaders and how they map to the RDNA hardware
- explains the classical pipeline and how the mesh shading pipeline differs
- presents which AMD hardware stages are used to implement the stages
- additional presents how amplification shaders can be used to represent dynamic workloads
