- the paper presents how to generate multiple 2D blue noise textures so that the blue noise is both spatially and temporally  a blue noise pattern
- the presented solution is a drop-in replacement for applications that are already using independent blue noise textures
- discusses how to generate the textures and compare multiple methods
- it additionally presents a comparison of the technique in multiple test cases and compares against other methods
- take a look at the supplemental for more practical information for real-time use cases
