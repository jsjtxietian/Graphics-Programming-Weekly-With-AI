2025-05-02: [Real-Time Markov Chain Path Guiding for Global Illumination and Single Scattering](https://www.lalber.org/2025/04/markov-chain-path-guiding)

- research paper presenting a novel lightweight path guiding algorithm for real-time applications
- uses a von Mises-Fisher mixture model controlled by a Markov chain process to represent light distribution
- demonstrates effective guiding for both global illumination and single scattering in participating media, with demos in a Quake path tracer
