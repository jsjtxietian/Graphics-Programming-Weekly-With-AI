2020-05-11: [A perceptual model of motion quality for rendering with adaptive refresh-rate and resolution](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/motion_quality_model/)

- this paper presents the results of testing done into human perception, comparing test-cases for perceived quality differences between resolution and framerate
- proposes a model for prediction to enable an application to dynamically adjust framerate and resolution based on the findings to achieve the highest perceived visual quality
