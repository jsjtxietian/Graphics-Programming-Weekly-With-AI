2024-09-02: [The Neural Light Grid: A Scalable Production-Ready Learned Irradiance Volume](https://research.activision.com/publications/2024/08/Neural_Light_Grid)

- the paper introduces a new method for precomputing indirect lighting into a novel form of Irradiance Volume
- It discusses how two approaches, one neural net and one parametric function based on ReLU fields
- presents performance and memory usage information and presents comparisons against existing solutions
- additionally discusses the limitations of the technique
