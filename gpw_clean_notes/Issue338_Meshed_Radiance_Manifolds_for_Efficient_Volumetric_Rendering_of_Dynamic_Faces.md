2024-04-23: [Meshed Radiance Manifolds for Efficient Volumetric Rendering of Dynamic Faces](https://syntec-research.github.io/FaceFolds/)

- the paper introduces a method for view synthesis of facial expression captures in 3D views not captured
- the presented solution is running at real-time rates without relying on machine learning techniques
- achieved using a layered mesh for view-dependent information and mixing this with view-independent RGBA texture video
- the included paper presents a summary of the technique, compares it against existing solutions, and discusses the limitations of the approach
