2023-10-09: [Ray Tracing Spherical Harmonics Glyphs](https://momentsingraphics.de/VMV2023.html)

- the paper introduces a new method to render Spherical harmonics glyphs efficiently
- SH glyphs are used to visualize High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)
- presents how to intersect the rays, calculate bounding boxes, as well as how to apply shadows
