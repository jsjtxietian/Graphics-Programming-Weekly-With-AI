2021-09-11: [Perceptual Model for Adaptive Local Shading and Refresh Rate](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/alsarr/)

- the paper introduces a new metric, CaMoJAB
- this considers how the judder, aliasing, and blur artifacts introduced by VRS are masked by the sensitivity limits of the visual system
- presents how to use the metric to derive VRS shading rate as well as required refresh rates
