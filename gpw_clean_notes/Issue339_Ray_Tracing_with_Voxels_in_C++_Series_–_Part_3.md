2024-05-13: [Ray Tracing with Voxels in C++ Series – Part 3](https://jacco.ompf2.com/2024/05/08/ray-tracing-with-voxels-in-c-series-part-3/)

- the article continues the development of a voxel raytracer by explaining anti-aliasing and soft shadows
- presents the difference between numerical integration and stochastic integration solvers
- shows the technique with anti-aliasing first and derives soft shadows as a follow-up
